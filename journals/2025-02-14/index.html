            <h3 id="gao-xiao-shi-duan">高效时段</h3>
<ul>
<li>0900-1000 FRL project meeting. Lot's of insights from PhD student who taught us how
to organize a project to make it publishable.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="zhong-xiao-shi-duan">中效时段</h3>
<ul>
<li>1000-1200 FRL reading session. Honestly, I was reading to catch up with the progress,
and to be perfectly honest I don't feel like I've learnt much from that session.</li>
<li>1400-1600 Contact hour/lecture. I was quite bothered by the Valentine's Day stuffs
on that day to truly focus on the lecture. The lecture wasn's so hard and I followed
it nevertheless. But still, was feeling perturbations in my heart.</li>
<li>1610-1640 FRL second project meeting (with another PhD student). I like how he both
indicated his interest, but at the same time laid out hist boundaries. It's just
a mature way to handle things when it gets 公事公办.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="you-xiao-xiu-xi">有效休息</h3>
<ul>
<li>1315-1400 Talked to friends and helped them got "free" coffee from the CompArch
corridor. I'm becoming the coffee guy now 🦐🦐 (and people say I make better
Lattes than the coffee truck downstairs, tho I suspect it's just that I put
more milk in it). Made myself a cortado as well~</li>
<li>1900-2200 Valentines formal with good friend AZ and long talk afterwards. 说爽了</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="yuan-xiao-lu">元效率</h3>
<ul>
<li>0730-0845 2024-02-12 journal 补档</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="jin-tian-de-guan-cha">今天的观察</h3>
<ul>
<li>Yeah the 1400-1600 PM emo period seems a bit more permanent now, after observing
it consistently for over a week. It's just the worst time for proper cognitive
activities. From next week onwards avoid scheduling any brain intensive stuffs
in that block. Plan to go on walks/bike tours/gym sessions/extra curricular readings
instead. If I have to stay for lectures, maybe I should avoid my morning coffee on
that day just to avoid the blues when the caffine wanes off.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="qi-ta-de-hua">其他的话</h3>
<ul>
<li>Here comes (a little bit of) the sun!
<img src="/img/department_sun.png" alt="bauhaus_sun" />
It's almost the first time we've seen the sun in over a week (and according
to the weather forecast, the last time we're going to see the sun in over a week's time).
Yeah and I guess our department (the inside bit) looks (for the lack of styles)
a bit Bauhaus. Not for the design but rather almost the lack of it. It resembles
what would be built in the early 1930s as a result of the materials and technology
available at that time (even though at the same time that huge pane of glass we
look through suggests otherwise).</li>
<li>The last bit of today's sun reached me through a couple of classmates
sitting in front. Golden (and warm I'd imagine) rays traced out
the silhouette of these friends, and on their ways scattering under
their skin, created on their faces some pink flush. It reminds me of
something wonderful, golden memories from a long time ago.</li>
<li>It'd be a lie to say that I wasn't in the least a bit bothered by today's
occasion. But the feelings are also just a little bit mixed (yeah it's a shame
that the first Valentines day which happens to fall on a Friday (or anywhere near a
weekend where we would have had the chance to meet up and go out properly)
happens to be the first one since our break up 💔), but also just
reflecting on my beliefs surrounding Valentines day, how I've let consumerism
(more specifically, anti-consumerism) defined me (but to be defined by the
inverse of something is to ultimately be defined by that thing itself), what
all this package (Valentines day, love, romance, surprises, reciprocity, etc.)
now means to me, and hoping someone hasn't developed an increasing level of
alcoholism.</li>
<li>But I'm glad that I wasn't stuck on this feeling the whole night. I'm very grateful
to my friend's presence tonight at the Valentines day formal, and I've had
the most interesting conversation (though the latter half is probably more of me
babbling than him) with AZ. We've always been friendly, but now I have the feeling
that our friendship would extend beyond the end of my years in Cambridge (or even
the UK).</li>
