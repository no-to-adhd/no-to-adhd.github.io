<p>1330-1520 First session with counsellor. To be honest, I don't think the
counsellor has been that helpful. It's more just me trying to get some of my
thoughts over the past few weeks out of the system, than her giving effective
guidance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I mentioned the situation back home, how, I've both taken steps to
understand my parents better, but at the same time still not entirely sure
what I can do to help, her suggestion seemed lukewarm and not really
helpful. "Sometimes there's only so much we can change, and we can only
accept our limitations". Maybe she doesn't quite understand either the
perceived severity of the my problem, or how east Asian family dynamics
differ. She doesn't understand the part that I CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE and
soon will be capable to, I'm just not sure what exactly can I do that won't
make matters worse. <em>I know what I'm not being saved by some one else when
I go to counselling/therapy, I'm just going through the process to
understand myself better to handle my own situation.</em> But still, avoiding
any meaningful conversation on that end entirely was far from desirable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon what was essentially my own reflection sessions: I've noticed that I
subconsciously "don't want to get in other people's way" despite that the
fact that I don't really like this idea. This tension begins to manifest
itself when I confront my loved ones (or those I thought who loved me),
when I want to live out of this fa√ßade and "be myself", yet what I often
ended up doing was to fixate on "what I really want for myself" to an
extreme, almost like I was trying to balance out the ÂßîÂ±à I felt out there.
In other words, I was being Á™ùÈáåÊ®™ in this case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The discussion on how I don't like to seek help from friends is true.
Even though I know this from perhaps a long time ago (and this definitely
appears in my own reflection a lot), the fact that I don't want my friends
to know that I'm in a bad state/doing worse than them is something that
bothers me. I care about my image in a toxic way. By bringing this up
in the session, I guess I'm getting an extra nudge when I have to encounter
this kind of situation next time, from someone who has nothing else to do
with my life. This kind of nudge is quite different from those I got from
my family and loved one, who, by knowing their expectations of me, only
makes me feel worse subconsciously. My feelings to my family and loved ones
are too complex to not get my own self-judgements projected on them, and
the feeling that I've been judged by people close to me, implicitly or
explicitly, makes me feel extremely vulnerable and insecure (which,
admittedly, probably relates to some childhood trauma). As a child, I feel
"undefended" by my parents in front of my classmates, friends and
competitors, who often, by setting other people as "role models", make me
feel "worse" or "less good". I've always had the feeling (at least when I
was a kid) that the only reasons my parents care for me in that way is
because they are morally "stuck" with me, and they would probably be better
if they adopt all those "role models" (who all happened to be girls?) as
their own. I always feel betrayed and abandoned when something like that
happens. In some ways I'm being the "middle child" in a single child
family, or lest that how I felt. My response to this? Build an perfect
cocoon around myself to shut them up, even when I'm crying within.</p>
<p>As adults we know that's not true. However crude or rudimentary they tried
to show their love, they didn't do that because they wanted someone
else as their own child, and, however wrong they might have been, never
deliberately abused me or physically harmed me. And to translate this strategy
with my parents to when I deal with my friends and loved ones is just outright
absurd. Another way to think about it is that, friends who judge you
for your problems are not worth making anyways, and, unlike parents, I have
a choice here. Instead of making myself uncomfortable in this situation,
I have the choice to just leave.</p>
<p>(This is not the same as having a friend who points out my problems though.
I appreciate the latter, knowing that they DON'T EXPECT anything from me
other than for my own good. And much as I like to have my friends around,
I'm psychologically less afraid of my friend "abandoning me" than it would
be the case for my family or my partner.)</p>
<p>In many ways I have been plagued by this insecurity for too many years.
I was first afraid to be "abandoned" by my parents, and then, when I
got into a long-term relationship with my ex, her. The more insecure I
felt, and harder I clang on. Since the age of 12, I've lost the
concept of a "home", and it almost feels like I've never had one: there's
not one corner on earth that makes me feel safe and secure, where I can
freely be what I want. The moment I met her, I thought I found that place.
And for the next eight years, where-ever she was was where I would call home,
a safe place for me, the closest I've got to either a family or heaven.
Yet upon reflection, that insecurity has plagued this relationship from the
start. I both felt comfortable enough to feel complacent in the
relationship, but also insecure enough to constantly "test her limit" for
her love. The latter always come back in mild disappointment because, well,
no one is obliged to love you beyond themselves, (or to love you
unconditionally?). She's always prioritized herself over me (and that's
healthy), and I both deeply admire her for that, and at the same time felt
insecure for that exact same reason. I thought, at the time, that I've
built myself a second family (a true family), and I clang on to it the
best I can, not knowing that the more desperately I did so, the worse it
looks like for the other party. (There were, brief moments in that
relationship when I felt I was truly getting better and secure. My second
year in Singapore in particular (our first year together), when I worked my
way out to be almost the top in cohort for social studies (a course for
which, I was at the dead bottom of my class a year before), got myself a
gold medal for a junior physics Olympiad, got into another physics
tournament (though this one is, complicated, and deserves another post on
its own). But even then, the modes in which we interacted was still plagued
by my insecurity of losing her. In many ways, it always made this fear a
self-fulfilling prophecy).</p>
<p>Ultimately, the fear of "abandonment" is almost a problem that could
be analyzed through the semantics alone: to be abandoned you must first
be attached. Not only that, whoever's afraid of abandonment must
have willingly given up their control over this attachment, and left it
in the other person's hand. To be frightened of abandonment, one must
have first willingly given up the controls he has over his own life (or
at least a very important part of it). Yet the more he does so, the
less secure he would be, and in worse ways would he cling on to this
attachment, ultimately making life worse for every one involved.</p>
<p>So now, the whole phrase ÊàêÂÆ∂Á´ã‰∏ö means something totally different.
It's not just "meeting the right person" and "have a family together"
and "build a career". No, it's about actively building yourself a "love
nest", a place where you can be yourself, be loved by yourself, and as
a bonus be loved by the people you care about, "a place for yourself in
this world". Some people are born with a place safe enough for them to
call home. I was never fortunately enough to have that. Yet with 3/4 or
so of my life left, it's not too late for me to build myself something
similar, a place where I can call home.</p>
