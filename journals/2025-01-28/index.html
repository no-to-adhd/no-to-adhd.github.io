<p>We can't have change without loss.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="things-i-need-to-remember">Things I Need to Remember</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Be nice/compassionate to yourself. Treat your own sadness/pains as if how a friend
would console you. Being reflective doesn't mean being self-critical.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start being aware of how I treat myself (how I talk to myself, choices I make
to my lifestyle, am I in my head), don't torture yourself. (Torturing yourself
is when you react to pain by creating misery. When you translate your pain ).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No emotional crutch. Facing your emotions (sadness, loss) is more healthy than
try to turn it to something else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow yourself to be sad. But don't torture yourself. Facing the sadness heads
on is a testament to the fact that what you've had was real, and that you really
do care about it. However, it is not the same with diverting your sadness to
something and someone else, because</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>两个人哪怕相爱也可能会伤害对方，相爱的人也可能需要离开彼此。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>我改变自我的人生的目的不是为了复合，而是为了我自己。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>值得我思考的，这段感情中，我的负面体验是怎么样的？我为什么会认为这个体验是负面的？</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="things-that-s-worth-telling">Things that's worth telling</h3>
<ul>
<li>我除了睡觉催眠（也只催眠了一小时以外）没有看B站。我今天甚至有点不想打开B站。</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-did-i-spend-the-day">How did I spend the day?</h3>
<details>
    <summary>🐷不要看，我不想让你有负担</summary>
    <div>
    <p>In pain, mostly. I found it hard to sleep, to concentrate, to work or to do
anything. All I could think about is what could give me another chance with
🐷. But in the end I quit, not because I stopped loving her, but because I
realized from <a href="#things-i-need-to-remember">my call with V</a> that if I
truly love her, I need to face the pain on my own, just so I know how real the
love was. I needed to face the pain and acknowledge that, there is a very real
chance that we're not going to get back together.</p>
<p>I understood that, the sharp pain I am feeling right now must have
been on her mind for a long time, maybe as long as a year or two, maybe for as
long as she can remember now. I'm sorry things went that way, and I'm truly sorry
for how I let her feel. I trapped myself in my own prison, thinking my life
was over, when I literally had the keys to the prison cells in my hands. Worse
still, I dragged her to me with all my strengths, thinking she'd want my company,
not knowing that from her eyes, I'm dragging her to a hopeless cave of horror.</p>
<p>So I woke up, or maybe I took my blindfold off, either way, I realized that the key
to that prison is my own fear. I need to look at it, feel it, and insert it into
the key hole that is my heart. Only then do I realize that fear was nothing, nothing
but an illusion my pain in the past used to keep me at bay.</p>
<p>So for us to split up was probably for the best, at least until I know deep in
my heart that I've changed enough to be living a fulfilling life on my own. No
one's got their life under control, but to look at it in the eye and fight to
hold the rein was much better than letting go in wait of meaningless life (and
so, death), the fight itself is worth the trouble
(与天奋斗其乐无穷，与地奋斗其乐无穷，与人奋斗其乐无穷) . It is only then will I
try to get back to 🐷, knowing we can only make it better from then on. For that
reason alone do I want to change quickly, knowing that my chances are diminishing
by the day. I must act fast, and fight back on my life.</p>
