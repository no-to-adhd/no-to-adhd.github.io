<p>To all the women viewing this website: happy International Women's Day!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><small>üößThis journal entry is a work in progressüöß</small></p>
<h3 id="a-note">A Note</h3>
<p>The journal entries for the rest of this week is coming; however, I'll need
a bit more time to clean them up since much of them contains partial writings
or shorthands for myself.</p>
<h3 id="things-i-ve-done-today">Things I've done today</h3>
<p>Honestly, not too much. Spent the morning eating and doing grocery; spent the
entire afternoon exercising, and spent much of the evening recuperating from
4 hours of cardio.</p>
<ul>
<li>I woke up at 8 today (instead of the normal 0630, though I did wake up then, I
realized I was only having 4.5 hrs of sleep and decided to get 1.5 hrs more).</li>
<li>0800-0830: Really relaxing shower</li>
<li>0830-0930: Learnt about protein intake, how to bulk up etc.</li>
<li>0945-1030: Went to brunch alone because no one else has booked</li>
<li>1030-1115: Grocery shopping (got a lot of proteins still, forgot to buy canned
tuna which reported is a very cheap source of protein)</li>
<li>1115-1200: Revised and modified my lexer code.</li>
<li>1330-1830: Went to Frisbee session. Most intense sport I've had in a while tbf,
but it was fun. The sense of accomplishment comes from
<ul>
<li>It's my first time playing, and I wasn't completely useless in the field.</li>
<li>I actually persevered through a 4-hour game despite wanting to leave early
multiple times after exhaustion (well I wasn't exhausted, on hindsight
I was chickening out a bit).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1830-2100: Chilled a bit, then my phone completely died (it's a brick now and
beyond salvageable), so I went to look for solutions; also took a nice shower,
and had dinner.</li>
<li>2100-2130: Chilled a bit more after dinner. Learnt about the Jung's personality framework
and got increasingly confused.</li>
<li>2130-0100: Parser implementation (partial, headers only).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="things-i-m-proud-of-this-week">Things I'm proud of this week</h3>
<ol>
<li>First and foremost: I wrote a lexer and a parser, spent 15 hours of totally uninterrupted
and not-distracted coding. While I wouldn't say this experience is by itself transformative,
it has reaffirmed my belief that I do like writing code and solving problems, just not
how it was taught in Cambridge (and perhaps some of my own methods). And the fact that
I was able to just sit there and do it, going into the flow and solving problems as I go
literally without thinking about anything else, is just the nicest experience in the world. The
affirmation I got from this activity has kept me very energetic (and I feel very motivated
and accomplished) throughout the day (and the next day).</li>
<li>I played tennis and Frisbee (I'm ... not good at either, but it's worth
trying) this week, in addition to hitting the Gym four times and doing
push-ups in my room. I feel super active and energized.
<ul>
<li>On my first Frisbee session: it's really the first time I socialized with
Chinese people outside my own department/college/people I knew before uni.
Boy playing from 2-6pm almost non-stop is quite... an experience.</li>
<li>An apparently these people do rock climbing as well and my friend seems to be quite a
novice at it. I guess it's worth a shot going with him.</li>
<li>Things I've observed: I am becoming slightly more proactive now (in team sports),
did a good job defending against one of the other players and blocked a
number of times. My lack of confidence (because I'm still bad at catching/throwing
the Frisbee where I want it to go) prevented me from taking a more aggressive
role in offence, and as a result I played more auxiliary roles (blocking, pick and roll
etc (though on hindsight that's supposed to be a foul loll...)).</li>
<li>Sports wise I do wish to be more proactive (gymming isn't mentally very
challenging in the sense that you don't have the responsibility of a team
sport, which psychologically has always been an issue to me because I was
afraid to take on responsibilities when I'm not confident with the sport
itself).</li>
<li>Boy, playing a sport from 2pm to sun down is an experience I've never had in my life.
I guess that's what It's like for my friends at lower sec who played basketball
or football all the time. It's quite an experience to say the least.</li>
<li>In general playing team sports expose you to a number of people whom you can tell
are extremely extroverted and sociable. They are, in that sense, eminent presence,
and one can tell why some people would like them. I currently don't feel excessively
confident in front of those people, but I do think it's worthwhile to meet them more
for this type of events (socials aside, they've been a massive boost to my cardio)
and to eventually make friends with some of them. I haven't proactively made new
friends in a very long time (that's perhaps never how I'd make friends), and
even just for the sake of knowing exactly what kind of people I like and dislike
talking to, it's worthwhile to try.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>My sleep schedule is stabilizing to a good point now. Granted I'm not exactly sleeping for 7 hours
a day (on average I'm getting 6.75 hours a day), but I feel super energized and ready to lit my
day on fire every single day. Well, if I can stay energized for 1 less hour of sleep each day,
I'm getting so much more time to get things done.</li>
</ol>
