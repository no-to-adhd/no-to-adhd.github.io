<h3 id="life-happening">Life Happening</h3>
<ul>
<li>0800-1045 I called 🐷, one last time. I feel bad (both for selfish and not so selfish reasons)
that I didn't get her to talk all that much during the process. I wish she's feel
that she's had a good talk and is ready to embark on life much as I do.</li>
<li>1045-1200 Noting things down, jotting down what I can remeber from the call so I won't forget.</li>
<li>1430-1730 Met V and had a talk. Fruitful and enjoyable talk in many ways. Key takeaways:
<ul>
<li>Life gets at us. Daddy issues (or issues with parents in general) takes a long time to
fix or heal, even if you feel better in every other aspect of life and
are actively resolving things.</li>
<li>The trip may not be as good an idea as it sounds... Think very carefully how you'd deal
with an ex (and don't make mistakes). Changes takes a year or two to make (and for its
effects to realize in your life).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="shen-qi-jing-li">神奇经历</h3>
<ul>
<li>1915-2045 I went to a poem reading?! I guess what I've learnt is that:
<ul>
<li>I'm happy I'm there not because I know I'd like it... But because I was there to honour a promise:
I met a CS PhD student (working on NLP) on my way home who invited me
to this event. He was so nice that I found it hard to reject him (frankly,
I should be better at rejecting people) and told him I'd give it a go. I
was really hesitant whether it was about time for me to leave for the
event, but decided to go anyways because I want to be <strong>DEPENDABLE</strong>
according to my <a href="https://no-to-adhd.github.io/blog/new-year-resolution/">new year resolution</a>. So even
though I didn't exactly like it (it was a waste of time... sorry to say
that), but at least I kept a promise.</li>
<li>I don't like English poems... They are too plain and unrhythmic.</li>
<li>I want to record my life down. I want to be 76 and still know exactly 44
years and 2 months ago my son read Tintin and talked about Captain Haddock.
A vector for memory as it were, builds its own story.</li>
<li>I fell asleep listen to it, maybe that's a good way to get me to sleep better😆.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="qi-ta-de-hua">其他的话</h3>
<p>There's so much I want to eventually say and reflect on today's talk ... and it probably
won't fit in a single reflection section. Besides, some part of that talk probably age
better with time. Regardless, this is it: radio blackout. <strong>PEACE OUT</strong></p>

Dude: But can we change things if we do it differently<br />
Neil: <strong>What's happended happended, which is an expression in faith in the mechanics of the world, it's not an excuse to do nothing</strong><br />

Dude: What do you call it?<br />
Neil: Reality. Now let me go<br />
Dude: Hey you never did tell me who recruited you Neil<br />
Neil: Haven't you guessed by now? You did! Only not when you thought. You have a future in the past. Years ago for me, years from now for you.
Dude: You've known me for years?!?
Neil: For me, I think this is the end of a beautiful friendship.<br />
Dude: But for me this is only the beginning.<br />
Neil: We get up to some stuff, you're gonna love it. You'll see, this whole operation is a temporal pincer<br />
