<p><small>üöß The other sections of this journal entry is still in progress üöß</small></p>
<h3 id="qi-ta-de-hua">ÂÖ∂‰ªñÁöÑËØù</h3>
<p>Not contact was broken... But I like what came out of it.</p>
<p>üê∑ told me that she really likes her new job, really enjoys the atmosphere, is
encouraged by her managers and colleagues, and is looking forward to staying
in the company for a couple more years (2-3) before she may decide to go back
to education again. She sounds really happy, and I'm also super, super excited
for her.</p>
<p>This does spell a death sentence for me in terms of getting back with her. Yet
I'm so happy (so much so that, to calm myself down for more work, I went
down to the gym to work out a bit) because</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I'm really, really happy to see that she's in a happy place and has a very
positive outlook of life. It's such a departure from her honestly miserable
state this time last year, and I'm really, really happy that's the case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's also a relief that, once the whole option of getting back together
becomes a bit of a whim (a bit too much to overcome with what I can do
alone), I've lost a thing I worry about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To be honest, I genuinely cherished this relationship, and I don't regret
having it. The memories I had with her were golden, dreamy, loving and
heartwarming to recall. Despite what's been said during the breakup, I can feel
her love for me even till the second we parted in Singapore (
I used to mildly dislike it when she bit me on my cheeks, but gosh no one is ever
gonna do that to me again ever, and boy I didn't know that's gonna go down
as my one of favourite moments in life. We hugged and cried so much when we
parted, and the love at that moment was definitely definitely real, even in the
last minute we were together. And I will not allow <em><strong>ANYONE</strong></em> to take that
memory away from me, or to tamper it, to rewrite it in any way, shape, or form
to say that we didn't love each other back then. That was our love, and to me
it is sacred).</p>
<p>But on hindsight, the relationship also gave me a lot of stress because it
felt like too much responsibility for me to fulfill at the time. There's
the constant joggling between my own wishes for myself, our wish for the
family life, my own family, and everything in between. I felt very lost
back then and just couldn't handle it. My solution was to avoid all of these
and sink into an abyss of helplessness and self-hatred, to make myself
feel so bad, that my inaction and inability to change the situation seemed
justifiable. I'm glad that, by forgoing the <em>id√©e fixe</em> of wanting to get
back with her (not that I don't hope for it, but that I just don't actively
pursue that future as a priority), I can feel the last thing holding me
back from focusing on improving my own life gone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I've been getting happier this week, surrounded by friends who reach out to
me, who allowed me to expose my vulnerabilities (some already did a few weeks back)
and gave me the both the rational analysis and emotional support I needed.
I've been talking to more friends and been exposed to more perspectives, some
of which are quite inspiring and helpful even outside of the context.
I've been going to gardens, to concerts, watched a movie and cried.
I guess I'm getting better at enjoying my own life without attachment. I'm
inspired and determined to make my life better and live mine as brilliantly as
yours, if not just for some friendly competition, a little bit better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To üê∑: yes I have been talking to people about our relationship and the fallout,
but you know me well enough and should be able to trust me enough that I would
NEVER, NEVER slander you for any reason. I said what I said to honour my memory
of that relationship, and like I said before, they are golden, loving, warm
and almost like a dream. I remember you just like when we were in our happiest
moments, and I would never betray that. I told my friends that, "I can't
see there's anything I don't like about you" (except smoking perhaps, because
lung cancer is such a horrible way to die and I've seen it myself, please
quit if you can, or quit when you feel more comfortable about quiting later in
life). There were definitely moments in our relationship I told you something
like "I'm so happy... I can die right now. I'm just happy, I'm exactly where I
want to be", and I bet with all my life there were moments you felt the same.
I'm just fortunate to have loved so deeply and passionately, and that has made my
life beyond wonderful.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, I just want you to know that I'm really, really genuinely happy for you, not
because I want to impress you or because I'm motivated to get back with you. Quite
the contrary, when all the intricacies of a relationship (expectations, hopes,
commitments...) have been taken away from the equation, all there is left is just
the sheer excitement and joy for you because your life is in a good place, even
if that good place can be absent of my presence.</p>
<p>I just want to shout to the world: CONGRATULATIONS!!!! I'M SOOOO HAPPPYYY FOR YOUUUU!!!!</p>
