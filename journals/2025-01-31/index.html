            <blockquote>
<p>I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that
brings total obliteration. I shall face my fear. I will permit it to pass
on and through me. When it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to
see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing left. <em>Only
I will remain</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have learnt to recite the <em>litany against fear</em>, over the last couple of
days. When I first watched that movie, I never could quite understood
the whole part on "An animal caught in a trap will gnaw off its own leg to
escape. What will you do?". To me, 断臂求生 seemed like a normal thing to
do. What other options do you have?</p>
<p>In that sense, I truly wasn't really different from other animals, acting upon
my fears and emotions and less so my intelligence. I act upon my first
instinct, express my outrage without a second of hesitation, act up when kids cry
on the train, or some sweaty, smelly bloke pass by me on the street. This was
what I seeked for going into this relationship 8 years ago, tired of
calculating my moves, and hiding away my feelings.</p>
<p>But there is some subtlety there: to be true to your feelings is not the same as
letting it dictate your life. Fear, or, more specifically, the fear of
pain, death, misfortune, fear of a specific future, is always going to be
there regardless. An animal gnaws off its own leg because its acting out of
fear, struggle restlessly to get out of the cage because its fear compells it
to (like when a cat is forced to enter some enclosed space, even if the human
is actually trying to cure its disease). A human may look at the trap, look for
its weakness, ponder about what could be done, wait when the hunter get back,
save his strength and strike just when and only when the hunter comes around.</p>
<p>Life is not going to play out as if it's a pre-written story ready to be played
out, it is an adventure in which we always have to face things we fear the
most. To let it get the better of me was never going to be good to people
around me, even if I felt I got immediate relief. My family taught me to be
afraid of the consequences of failures and misfortunes, which supposedly was
their way to teach me to think and plan beforehand. Unbeknownst to them, It
played out completely in reverse in me, because I let the fear conquer me from
the other side. My response now is therefore to embrace my fear, and only by
knowing what causes the unrattling in the deep, do I understand more what needs
to be done, what needs to be fixed, and what I really cherished.</p>
<p>It is truly powerful. The moment I say "I will permit it to pass over me and
through me", like Paul in the movie, this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RooSqqn1FjA&amp;ab_channel=MiZzan">powerful
vocal</a> rings at
the back of my head. <strong>Only I will remain</strong>.</p>

<details>
    <summary>🐷: I&#x27;ve got some long confession to make here, and I&#x27;m hesitant for you to see</summary>
    <div>
    <p>I've been missing her more today. Maybe it's because I'm less busy, or maybe
she's been less attentive to my messages, a sign that, at least from my point
of view, she's less interested in me (and <em>rightfully so, what's not clear about
what a break up means</em>). It kinda hurts to know that, even when I'm supposed to be
moving on. But then again thinking about it, that's how she's always replied to
my messages over the past month or so. What's painful wasn't how she's replied
(or how she hasn't), but the painful realization that, however much she doesn't
care now, she hasn't for the past couple of months, but my numb and insensitive
heart didn't get her distress call at the time. I was imagining a perfect
relationship, one which has a long history of commitment, and, where the pain
of long distancing will end in almost no time. I will make time to see her
during the spring break, and everything will be fine the moment our eyes
crosses and give each other a hug. Or so I thought.</p>
<p>It is only the loss of a long relationship that made me realize that the best
way to maintain it was when you're still in the other person's life. Now
that I'm increasingly, slowly but surely, edged out of hers, all of a sudden
all the things I can think of to do, things that might have worked if we were
still together, became less acceptable simply because we're not in a
relationship anymore. What am I even supposed to do as a friend? Can I still
show that I really care for her and want to do (much belated, maybe too late)
anything beyond what friends normally do? Does she like the idea that I still
care and want her in my life in some way or does she want me to leave her
alone? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.</p>
<p>I still believe that maybe ending our relationship was the best thing to do.
Perhaps the moment she heard from me that it's unlikely for me to be in
Singapore next year, and so there's no concrete way for the two of us to be
physically together for another year and a half, was enough to convince her
that there's too much pain to endure in the forseeable future for things to
truly work out. Being in long distance is hard, making it one year longer has
made it even harder, and, on top of that, if there's already a not so healthy
relationship to begin with, I can't imagine painful it must be. Perhaps she
viewed my unwillingness to move to Singapore as a sign of lacking commitment, or
perhaps she's afraid of all the fights she's expecting from me when she's going
to tell me that she wants to be in Singapore for one more year (because, of
course, I really want her back). There's so many, so many reasons that she
could be unhappy with this relationship, that the moment I put myself in her
shoes, I felt sorry. When long distancing became a burden in her mind(and
frankly mine as well), it is best if we give it some time to break (and that's
just me) (and yes, she thinks it's over, at least not until life, or,
deliberate choices we make, brings us back together again).</p>
<p>I don't know, the reason why I didn't want our relationship to end wasn't that I know
exactly how to make a long distance relationship work, or that I wasn's worried and
wasn't frankly suffering just a bit down my heart as well. It was the bigger
fear of uncertainty that made me want to hold on to it, even when I knew there
was something seriously wrong there. I can't imagine her being with someone
else, and, oh boy don't get me started when her new relationship starts to get
physical. In my mind, the future stops on that day, and the fear of this
potential future prevents me from fabricating a future story beyond that point.
I still love her, and love sometimes is selfish.</p>
<p>But <em>I shall not fear, for fear is the mind killer. I will face it, let it pass
on and through me, so when it's gone there will be nothing left. Only I will remain</em>.
So I must acknowledge that, this is a not an unlikely scenario, at least by the
end of these two long years. She's an attractive young female who's enjoying
her mid twenties, just started her day job and is enjoying life in most sense
of it. Man will be <strong>crazy</strong> for her for more than just one reason, reasons I
know too well and have felt too deeply. (And to not torture myself I will not
think too much about exactly <em>who</em> is the next person going to be like, I've
got soo many candidates out in my mind, and, oh boy). I should have realized
that, the moment she said "she didn't want to <strong>WAIT</strong>", there is unfortunately
something deeper there. It is a future that I have to embrace, to accept that,
by the end of the day, she wasn't all wrong when she said "It's a shame, but
I'm also glad that we've broken up." I wasn't thinking deeper when I first
heard that, I was confident that, now that I feel <em>truly</em> different over the
last couple of days, by the time she meets me again, our chances are still
high. I didn't realize that hidden betwene the lines is something about the
very concept of <em>time</em> itself: it's a shame that what we've had happened then
and there, and there's no going back. It is a painful realization, but to dwell
on it would just be misery.</p>
<p>So that's just that: I need to learn to move on, every last bit of it. I need
to learn to realize that, I should NOT be hoping for reconnection or getting
back together, because it leads to misery, and, less self development. The
latter is the last thing I want on my table.</p>
<p>中国人总喜欢说缘分，而我从小则被告知不能依靠命运，而需要自己去努力。但真正
的不珍惜是当缘分未尽是以为无需努力，当缘分散尽时，才知道想努力也不再有机会了。</p>
<p>但我要学会接受一点：只有做好了分开的准备，重逢才算是苦尽甘来。如果不能接受我们
大概率可能分开的事实，那我又怎么保证我们的重逢又会不会只是历史的重演呢？</p>
<p>只希望 我们人生中尚有一根细细的红线🎗️，让我可以按图索骥的找到你。</p>
