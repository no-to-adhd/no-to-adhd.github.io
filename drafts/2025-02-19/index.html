<p>and also something else, from a few days back:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: I feel shit ... but I won't break no contact. I'm messaging you (a friend) just to make that promise.<br />
VC (the friend): stay strong bro, ... do you wanna talk about it?<br />
Me: <talk about why I feel shit at that moment><br />
VC: <replied and told me how she relates to that from her break up><br />
Me: It's ok I've got this. Telling you this alr removes half the burden. Now I'll go and do some work.<br />
VC: Ok, but like, sit with how you feel for a bit longer. It makes the feelings less scary, knowing you're able to sit with it, and the intensity of it will pass.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, however positively we might see it, break-up still sucks, because
heart-breaking is what it is. It hurts because it feels like losing your
closest family. But just sit with the feeling, feel what you're feeling right
now, embrace it despite the pain. When you feel the full intensity of it (even
just to honour the relationship), you'll walk off the experience knowing that
you can handle it, and you're going to walk out of this, little by little.</p>

<p><small>🚧 This journal entry is still a work in progress 🚧 (Because █ is still trying to live out his day)</small></p>
<h3 id="yun-dong-jian-shen">运动健身</h3>
<p>今天与TC同学一起健身，成果如下</p>
<ul>
<li>卧推50kg×12, 55kg×7, 55kg×8 （有进步，目标2个月内推上65kg×12）</li>
<li>二头弯举12.5kg×12, 12.kg×10×2</li>
<li>哑铃推肩12.5kg×12×3</li>
<li>龙门绳索下拉</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, it was a good exercise session. I'm especially pround that
I've finally managed to push up to 55kg for the first time (the last
breakthrough was Nov 2024, it has been a long time). That means at
least on the gym front, I'm back on track 💪</p>
<h4 id="qi-ta-de-hua">其他的话</h4>
<!---->
<p>Seriously, in case you missed it. "🤷‍♂️ okay..😊". I'm not sure in what
ways are they reciprocal, but yeah, that's what I really wanted to say.</p>
<!-- I had the thought of locking up this journal for at least the duration of the -->
<!-- radio blackout (or to lock up each post for at least a couple of weeks before -->
<!-- release), I really do. Much as I really, really enjoy the attention I've -->
<!-- received, I'm also concerned about this journal's implications. -->
<!---->
<!-- For me, urges to break no-contact or even just  -->
<!---->
<!-- If you happen to be in a break-up and are feeling it hard, like in the quote -->
<!-- of the day, go and talk to someone you trust, or someone you think can relate -->
<!-- to your experience. It'll feel better that way than to try to deal with it -->
<!-- by ourselves. -->
<!---->
<!-- I hope this isn't breaking no contact. I really hope I'm just not thinking -->
<!-- straight and projecting my own insecurities on the tiny, tiny amount of -->
<!-- information from you seeping through the radio blackout wall we've built -->
<!-- ourselves. And much as I'm still  -->
<!-- On top of all that, here's something else I want to say: I still care about you, -->
<!-- and I thought (and still think) that we can be perfect together (with some work -->
<!-- and, the clarity we gained from this heart-breaking experience). But you've -->
<!-- made up your mind on this, and I want to take your decision very, very seriously. -->
