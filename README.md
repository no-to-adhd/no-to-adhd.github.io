# NO TO ADHD

This is a github page tracking my journey against ADHD. I'm not sure what's
going to go inside, but I'll make sure to record the things I've done until I'm
happy to say that I can fully attend to my life and make the myself a net
positive to people around me.

## What is this repository?

As a student of computer science, I have unfortunately never been motivated
enough to even make my own personal website. This site will therefore contain a
number of things: my own personal journey trying to get out of ADHD, some side
projects both for new skills and to have fun, and some more personal thoughts
and actions taken to finally tackle the disease that has plagued me for more
than a decade.

Each of the projects are themselves a testament to the journey of my recovery:
time I've spent working on self-motivated basis to learn new things, meet new
people, and make my life a little better.
