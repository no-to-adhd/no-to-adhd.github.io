Welcome to a totally unorganized place on the far corners of the internet.
This is █'s secret base to combat his PADHD (**P**otential **A**ttention
**D**eficit **H**yperactivity **D**isorder). I think I have many symptoms
of ADHD, but I was never diagnosed with it.

Interesting new quote:
> 好的享乐是可以满足的享乐。不可满足的享乐是“强迫的享乐”。

> 现代享乐主义的律令：人必须要快乐。
> 抑郁症——对于享乐主义律令的不完全反抗：人必须要“不”快乐。律令的暴政是其强制性。
> 另一种不完全的反抗：我可以快乐，也可以不快乐。 _为什么这也是不完整的反抗？_

### NOTICE
**Important Announcement: This site is still being updated daily. However,
as part of a recent agreement, I am no longer posting my journals here on a
daily basis. Instead, the journal entries will be kept private in the draft
section of the site until a better time for their release (if you really need
to check them out, see the draft section on the github repo or check out the
commit history). Blogs are still being updated when the opportunity arise (i.e.
when I get in the mood of writing).**

### Acknowledgement
**No viewer statistics is collected from this site now, the analytics have been
deliberately deleted so that whoever wants to see this can do so in the safety
of anonymity.**
