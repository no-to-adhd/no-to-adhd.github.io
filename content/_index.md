Welcome to a totally unorganized place on the far corners of the internet.
This is █'s secret base to combat his PADHD (**P**otential **A**ttention
**D**eficit **H**yperactivity **D**isorder). I think I have many symptoms
of ADHD, but I was never diagnosed with it.

### NOTICE
**Important Announcement: This site is still being updated daily. However,
as part of a recent agreement, I am no longer posting my journals here on a
daily basis. Instead, the journal entries will be kept private in the draft
section of the site until a better time for their release (if you really need
to check them out, see the draft section on the github repo or check out the
commit history). Blogs are still being updated when the opportunity arise (i.e.
when I get in the mood of writing).**

### Acknowledgement
**No viewer statistics is collected from this site now, the analytics have been
deliberately deleted so that whoever wants to see this can do so in the safety
of anonymity.**

### Credit
To see the brilliant theme I'm using, check out the [example
pages](./tags/example/) or Apollo's [configuration options](./posts/configuration).[^1]
