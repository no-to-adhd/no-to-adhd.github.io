> 我所拥有的是我的记忆，美妙的感觉…… Don't break my heart, 再次温柔，喜悦总是出现在我梦中。

黑豹 [_Don't break my heart_](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1bo4y1U7Tv) 以及[窦唯打鼓王菲唱的版本](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1PG411d71n).

### Life Happening

- 0800-1045 I called 🐷, one last time. I feel bad (both for selfish and not so selfish reasons)
    that I didn't get her to talk all that much during the process. I wish she's feel
    that she's had a good talk and is ready to embark on life much as I do.
- 1045-1200 Noting things down, jotting down what I can remeber from the call so I won't forget.
- 1430-1730 Met V and had a talk. Fruitful and enjoyable talk in many ways. Key takeaways:
    - Life gets at us. Daddy issues (or issues with parents in general) takes a long time to
        fix or heal, even if you feel better in every other aspect of life and
        are actively resolving things.
    - The trip may not be as good an idea as it sounds... Think very carefully how you'd deal
        with an ex (and don't make mistakes). Changes takes a year or two to make (and for its
        effects to realize in your life).

### 神奇经历

* 1915-2045 I went to a poem reading?! I guess what I've learnt is that:
    * I'm happy I'm there not because I know I'd like it... But because I was there to honour a promise:
        I met a CS PhD student (working on NLP) on my way home who invited me
        to this event. He was so nice that I found it hard to reject him (frankly,
        I should be better at rejecting people) and told him I'd give it a go. I
        was really hesitant whether it was about time for me to leave for the
        event, but decided to go anyways because I want to be **DEPENDABLE**
        according to my [new year resolution](@/blog/new_year_resolution.md). So even
        though I didn't exactly like it (it was a waste of time... sorry to say
        that), but at least I kept a promise.
    * I don't like English poems... They are too plain and unrhythmic.
    * I want to record my life down. I want to be 76 and still know exactly 44
        years and 2 months ago my son read Tintin and talked about Captain Haddock.
        A vector for memory as it were, builds its own story.
    * I fell asleep listen to it, maybe that's a good way to get me to sleep better😆.

### 其他的话
There's so much I want to eventually say and reflect on today's talk ... and it probably
won't fit in a single reflection section. Besides, some part of that talk probably age
better with time. Regardless, this is it: radio blackout. **PEACE OUT**
