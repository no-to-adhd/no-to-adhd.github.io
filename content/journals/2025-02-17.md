真是忽如一夜春风来啊（虽然原作是描述下雪的）。

### 互联网脚替第一弹：剑桥植物园
翻看相册，上一次去剑桥植物园已经是两年前的事情了。
今日（至少出发的时候）春光旖旎， 虽然实际上天寒地冻，
但是去了之后还是很值得的。

除了开头仅温室的几分钟，剩下的时间应该挺适合
读书或者休息的时候当背景放的。时不时夹杂着我的
口哨声和吐槽，建议降低音量。

本来的打算是下午在此处看论文，可惜咖啡厅人满为患，
吃完午饭后便往回走了。

听同桌的老太太说今天小学放假，很多家长带小朋友春游，
路上确实遇到不少小朋友。真是勃勃生机万物进发啊（老蒋音）！

### 今天的观察
- 中午与邻桌老太太的交谈：邻桌老太太是几十年前病毒学的学生，嫁给了一位计算机的老前辈（我系一位久经考验的老讲师[Dr.
Frank King](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fhk1/) (Apparently he used to supervise the legendary John Fawcett among many
other people in the department I know). However, apparently that doesn't
exactly resolve her fear of the internet or modern technology.
    - Apparently you DO TALK ABOUT THE WEATHER. That's a really effective way to make smalltalk
        at least with older folks (especially when the weather has been
        consistently bad and improved just a little).
    - Visit Granchester: she's been in Cambridge for over 60 years and she said it's nice.
        Apparently people used to punt all the way there.
    - Modern UI/UX design: older folks sometimes have a hard time adjusting to smartphones
        due to the sentivities of the modern system to various gestures. When their hands
        are no longer steady or quite as agile, scrolls could be detected as a swipe (in the wrong
        direction), tap could be detected as a hold. Accessibility issue is worth looking into.
    - I gave her a quick demo of LLMs (and also talked about hallucination, which she seemed quite
    weary of). With RAG-based knowledge augmentation, I suggested to her that "LLMs are as trustworthy
    as non-peer reviewed science literature". She still sounded concerned about online safety (probably
    referring to online scams) but looks impressed. I do hope that, all the safety concerns aside
    (well the industry seems very lukewarm about proposals surrounding security
    (not the same thing with safety tho)).

- Got myself a bottle of Georgian [Rkatsiteli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rkatsiteli) wine,
    apparently one of the oldest wine grape varieties in the world from the ancestral home of
    wine making itself (though that's probably highly debated between Georgia and Armenia), but
    I'm not so sure whether it's made in the traditional method with a
    traditional [Kvervri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kvevri) but regardless I'm reserving
    this for special occasions.

    Ever since I watched the movie [The Color of Pomegranates](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063555/)
    I've been fascinated with the wine making of that area (the original film reflects the
    culture of Armenia though), and it is exciting to finally get my hands onto one of those things.

- Talked to the barista girl (is her name Robie?) at the college bar. She's been giving
    me double espressos (or more formally dopio?) whenever I order for singles
    for a while now and she seemed very friendly. I feel quite light mooded today
    so I stayed for a little longer and talked over the bar. Got to tell my cat
    story back in Singapore for the first time in don't know how long (and to
    realize how fortunate I was to have won the kitten lottery back then, raising
    皮皮 from a little black kitten the size of my fist to a mascular little black
    panther in a span of 3-4 months was just a lovely experience). She taught me
    how to make a cortado properly so I'll try that next time. (And apparently
    we've got Columbian beans at the college cafe now so it taste smoother (she
    wasn't wrong)).

- On my way back home from the College, I do realize that I've got quite a
    variety of friends in Cambridge (though not as many as I wanted) whom I was
    quite happy talking to. They've all made my day, one way or another, and has
    helped me immensely throughout the last couple of weeks through my worst times.
    I'm happy to have them around (and I'm definitely not as introverted as I thought
    I was, based on the Big 5 test taken a while back I'm supposed to "prefer
    smaller gatherings and occasional social interactions", which I think is true).

- Just to add on: _I think I've had a really really happy morning by myself_.
