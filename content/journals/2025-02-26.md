> “当他离死亡越近时，他就离生命越近。” 生命是辩证法的冒险，生命是辩证法的胜利！

From yesterday:
> The key to self-motivation is: feeling competent at doing worthwhile work.
> - Always go for the good consequences.
> - Make you feel you have a choice: believe you have a sense of autonomy: go for
>     pleasantt consequences. Positive reinforcement
> - Build a sense of community. Adults are inter-dependent, not independent.

What I understand myself:
- I/E: I'm in between being extroverted and introverted.
- N: I'm more intuitive/empathetic than reasoning. I'm better at designing than analysis. My analysis skills needs to be trained.
- F: I'm a feeler. I may decide based on my feelings.

### 值得高兴的事情
- 早上早饭后顺手洗了碗筷
- 虽然今天起床后状态很差，但是经过一段时间主动调整，改善了自己的状态。I think I'm
    increasingly capable of handling my day-to-day mood, and is able to control it
    through the use of meditation, physical exercises and more.
- My current workflow to adjust my mood goes as follows:
    1. Identify that the mood came from my fear or avoidance of something.
    2. Identify what exactly I'm afraid of.
    3. List out the consequences if things goes well.
    4. List out the consequences if they don't.
    5. Recite [litany aginst fear](@/journals/2025-01-31.md), tell my self that fear
        doesn't do anything. See where the fear is allow me to gain better clarity to myself.
    6. If I still feel a bit anxious from the hormones, meditate for 5 minutes.
    7. Resume working.

### 高效时段
- 早上1230-1430 学习/复习C++ l/r/xvalue, move semantics, perferct forwarding
- 下午1535-1700 看论文+写论文总结
- 晚上2030-2345 写完论文总结

##### 任务分解
_考虑到我的ADHD症状，提前合理的分解任务很重要。将这些任务一一写下来有助于我更加专心_

### 有效休息
- 晚上1430-1535: 洗了个舒服澡，散步，洗衣服

### 浪费时间
最好没有 (基本上也没有）

### 元效率
- 晚上2000-2030：使用DeepSeek R1规划如何走出当今的困境，很有启发性的发言。
- 晚上2040-2240：新年规划+当日记录。其中当日记录用时40分钟。未来可以通过模板化加快。

### 今天的观察
- I love a good head rub. Rubbing my own head loosens up myself so much that
    it would probably work
