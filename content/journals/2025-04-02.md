🚧this entry is still a work in progress🚧

### Exercises

- Bench press 50kg×12, 60kg×9, 60kg×6 (inconsistency here is probably due to my lack of carb rich meal today).
- Bicep curls 12.5kg×10×3
- Front delt bell raise 12.5kg×10×2 17.5kg×10
- Lat raise 5kg×15×4

Reflection on my exercises:
1. I haven't trained my back in a while, should probably do that
2. Unfortunately I'm gonna miss some sleep today, which means the exercises I've done today probably doesn't go
    a long way in terms of muscle growth. But either way, it was good to spend time with T.

### Work
🚧this entry is still a work in progress🚧

Most of the productive work today will be done between tonight and early tomorrow morning.

### Other fun stuff
- Became a lab rat for another Psych experiment. Last time was TMS and now TES. I'll soon have a go at every single
non-intrusive brain physical brain stimulation experiment according to the PhD student who designed this experiment.

- Visited Addenbroke's for the first time. Wasn't too impressed by the building itself, but I would love to see how
the infrastructure just to get a general understanding of how a hospital work in the UK (but also, without actually
having to be their for any reason lol).
