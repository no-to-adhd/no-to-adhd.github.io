### 高效时段(8个Pomodoro钟共5小时20分钟)
- 1030-1745 Working in the lab. Read 3 papers (though more work is required to
    figure out the connections and exact methods)

### 背景学习/社交活动
- 1030-1745 Including lunch, probably talked to friends for about 2 hours total.
    I'm glad that I talked to a good number of friends, and I seem to know at
    least ~20 people in the department relatively well in my year (which is not
    nearly enough, but at least that the number of people who seem to click with
    me in some way (or those who are respectful enough)). Should probably try
    to work more in the ACS lab above all other places.

### 有效休息
- 1745-1945 Dinner, walking back home in the rain (not the best of all
experiences, solitude starts to encroach me just a little bit when I got all
wet and soggy).

##### Not so effective resting times
- Didn't sleep well at all today, even though technically I got 9 hours in

### 浪费时间
- 1945-2030 Watched bilibili for a bit. But to my justice I wasn't watching
    as much as I was using it as some form of hypnosis.

### 今天的观察
- The course I'm taking this year seems to focus a lot more on the quality of
scientific communication than the quality of the ideas. A few things I can reflect/improve
upon are:
    - When we are asked to critique a paper, we don't critique the quality of
        the _work_. Focus only on the quality of the writing and presentation.
    - For a lot of times we are marked down for the lack of clarity in writing.
        To improve on this situation, 

### 其他的话

##### Lingering thoughts
I kept a recording of my call with 🐷, and I keep noticing how I tend to talk
without a good central theme. I keep ditracting to other topics, and I guess by
the looks of it I failed to tell her how I appreciate her in a coherent manner.
(tbc: add a link to a blog post where I say that one last time (and also
password protect that one post)).

##### Bad Sleep
Couldn't sleep well night despite a total of 9 hours spent sleeping. There's a bit
about lights, but general mood as well. Despite the tiredness, the lesson is that
I should have carried on for a bit more, and potentially feel more refreshed despite
shorter sleep.
