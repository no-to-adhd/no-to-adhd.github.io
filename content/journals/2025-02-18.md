<!-- > @My EX: I have made a decision. Stay tuned for the blog post this weekend. -->

### 今日B站
今天起床的时候看一位长期关注的航空航天科普UP更新了，一看发现是他们哥几个聚会唱歌。
歌真不错，唱得也好。希望我三十多的时候能这样，肌肉不少，体脂率不高（比视频中的还
低一点），会弹吉他(或是什么别的便携点的乐器），高音唱得上去，还有一帮能一块弹唱的兄弟。

虽然一直在唱副歌，但是调调我确实很喜欢。

### 高效时段
- 1435-1515 Analyzed the code (I'm planning to modify) through LLM. It's supposed to
    work well but IRL each LLM has its own problem.
- 1600-1725 Learning PyTorch (yeah I'm late to the game, but it still felt good to have done it)

### 中效时段
- 0900-1000 Reading up on OS.
- 1000-1100 Fixing my broken Linux installation on my laptop yet again.

### 有效休息
![img](/img/concert-02-18.jpg)
The stage before the start of the concert. It's a really pretty place especially
after the stage lights were on. Judging by the colour of their hair, I'm mingling
a bit too much with older folks...?

- 1255-1415 Lunch time concert @ West Road Concert Hall
    - And I met the same old lady I met at the garden [yesterday](@/journals/2025-02-17.md)! What are the chances!
        Says a lot about my recreation these days...?
    - The harp piece [Handel's Harp
        Concerto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jHr4t3JiGc&ab_channel=JuliaRovinsky)
        is honestly very beautiful and relaxing. They played some more intense pieces
        after that, but I already fell asleep after the end of the first one (not in a
        bad sense, getting me some long wanted rest is frankly hugely appreciated). The
        later pieces honestly feels like intense movie BGMs (almost horror movie BGMs)
        but for some reason I still had a very relaxing nap during those.

<!-- TODO: include a picture of the concert -->
- 1415-1435 Sandwich for lunch. First time in quite some time.
- 1735-1850 Dinner + Grocery @ M&S (I'm there instead of Sains for very random reasons) + Walk home
- 2100-     今天早睡了。睡了8.5小时，睡眠质量也很好。

### 运动健身
- 俯卧撑 40×3. 现在做40个基本没有难度了。I've come a long way.

### 元效率
- 1515-1600 I felt absolutely shit. But instead of acting on my urge to break no contact,
    I talked to friends, sat with the feeling to know that some of it is ultimately driven
    by unnecessary fear, and felt better afterwards. Another success story I can tell myself
    on how I can manage panic attacks, longings, grief, all that without resorting to impulsive
    actions that I'll regret.

### Unfortunate Things

Windows update broke my Linux installation yet again...😮‍💨

### 其他的话

As aligned with the title (and url) of this website, it's time to talk about ADHD again.

I can feel my ADHD symptoms coming back (they've previously been supressed perhaps by
the intense emotional stimulus I've been feeling over the past few weeks). This might
explain why I tend to make drastic changes for the better when I've been strongly
affected by positive or negative emotional stimulus (e.g. the first year I got with
my ex. To me (ups and downs in the relationship aside, which admittedly I acted
very immaturely) that was one of my most accomplished year I can remember. Or perhaps
2020).

The ADHD symptoms becomes especially apparent when I take wake up from a nap,
or haven't rested well the night before (this seems to indicate that,
insufficient rest severely affects the operation of self-control and
attention). Whenever I'm supposed to do something boring (which, quite
unfortunately, includes reading most papers. Some of them are very fun and I
won't feel the ADHD at all). However, under my current circumstances, the immediate
response to my ADHD is to feel shit (like the episode I had this afternoon).

And yes I probably do have ADHD. I've had a look at the [diagnosis
form](https://bsw.icb.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/06/Adult-ADHD-Self-Report-Scale-ASRS-white.pdf)
used by the NHS, and I fcking tick ***ALL THE BOXES***. ALL THE BOXES!!! Not
just a few of them. All the boxes!! (Only 2/3 of the symptoms is required for a
diagnosis, I ticked all the boxes and almost always tick "very often" in all
of the options). For that reason, I have renamed PADHD from "Pretended ADHD"
to "Potential ADHD" (cuz there's a genuine chance that I do have that, given
all the symptoms).

I have contacted my GP (which I have somewhat stupidly re-registered with one in
London over the summer) to see if I can get tested. I still need to call them
again to make alternative arragements. While I do plan to get to London on 1
March for a Tchaikovsky concert (and also Mahler, two of my favourite pieces
played together in one concert, can't get better), they aren't open on
weekends. If possible, I also need them to refer me to a specialist in
Cambridge for any further assessments, because travelling to London solely
for the purpose of a medical appointment wouldn't be a good use of my time.

At this point, I believe medical intervention is the best course of action.
While some call ADHD a "neuro-divergence" and argues that it has its benefits
(which I most certainly agree with many of the things said, there are good sides
to ADHD, such as hyperfocus on things that you do really care about, (somewhat)
creative ideas, the ability to be interested in a wide range of things, the a lot of
energy when that'd be useful), it has affected my life for way too long and far
too deeply. I guess ADHD just makes life very very hard for me, and people
around you don't neccessarily love you for some of the symptoms.

That said, some of the side effects of the drugs used to treat ADHD include
bad appetite, potential insomnia, and "feeling aggressive, irritable, depressed,
anxious or tense". The last bit is exactly what I'd avoid even without the
medication. So I'm a little bit worried on that front.

The concluding remark today is this: while I may have ADHD, it isn't an excuse
for me to achieve nothing, or to not have control on how I feel. Quite the
opposite: the goal is to manage it like any other disease, either through
medication or otherwise. ADHD is just one side of me, just like everything else
about me (a bit short, square jaws, family who's been sick, and also good sides
of me (I'm caring, I am philosophically quite nurtured, good things ADHD have
brought me such as the ability to connect a lot of dots, the impulsive part
which can sometimes be desirable when I need to make bold choices)), it's just
a fact of life that I need to face now. Getting proper medical on this is a first
step (there are both medicinal and behavioural components to the treatment, I
still need to work hard on the behavioural half).

---

Talked to the GP and immediately realized that was NOT AN OPTION. The current
waiting time for initial assessment is ***12 months*** (wtf) (not including the
time for them to process the referral which is another 4 weeks). I guess I'll
have to just rely on self help for now.
