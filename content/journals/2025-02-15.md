> So now, the whole phrase 成家立业 means something totally different. It's not just "meeting the right person" and "have a family together" and "build a career". No, it's about actively building yourself a "love nest", a place where you can be yourself, be loved by yourself, and as a bonus be loved by the people you care about, "a place for yourself in this world". Some people are born with a place safe enough for them to call home. I was never fortunately enough to have that. Yet with 3/4 or so of my life left, it's not too late for me to build myself something similar, a place where I can call home.

Myself in [journal 2025-02-13](@/journals/2025-02-13.md). Yeah, that's a motivation now, and I'm excited to do it.

### 运动健身
- 16日晚1800-1930 卧推50kg×12 (有余力) 55kg×5 (不够，主要还是没保护不敢竭尽全力)。哑铃推肩 12.5kg×12×3。三头下拉27.5kg?×8×2

### 本周观察

- 本周有个小问题：还是有点嗜睡。每天起床时间基本固定在早6点到7点，但是有几天睡得太早了（9点左右），以至于
    没做完每周总结就睡了（所以好几天需要补档）。
    - 可能的解决方案：饭后（碳水太多或者其他）的时候做一些不太需要精力但是需要一定专注的事情，拖到不困了之后
        再做一些耗费脑力的工作。
- 本周确定每天2-4点是我自己胡思乱想内耗的时间。解决思路：去运动。
- 说实话，本周与J同学的相处不太满意：他帮助我还挺热情的，但是我有点被他的热情吓到了？
    我鸽了他的消息，并且当他来我宿舍区域的时候没有主动邀请他说话。考虑到他
    的可能的精神情况，老实说I haven't been a very good friend. I'm not sure if this is a type of avoidance issue (in response to
    people being too nice to me but also at the same time not doing exactly what I expected).
- Watched a lot of stuffs on "popular psychology" (so sometimes cliche stuffs). I've known the buzzwords for these
    concepts for a long time, but I was previously very unconvinced and dismissed them. While any psychological
    concept has their wider background/assumptions in sociology and ideology, some of the concepts appear applicable.
    More on that in my "saved for later" playlist on Youtube (the ones by "TheSchoolOfLife" and "Sysiphous").
- Daddy issue progress log \[2/???\]. Didn't talk to him this week (not because I haven't reached out. He's avoiding
    me this week). He asked for the url of this site and appeared very upset upon my rejection. ***Something I'm pround of***:
    I stayed calm, stated my reasons, and genuinely believed in what I said (which means I have expressed to him exactly
    how I want to shape our interactions). He's getting very defensive for some reason. Combining this with multiple
    past episodes where I don't want to share with him my bank transfer records, my bank account, my own diary, social media
    account and he became very upset, I think he genuinely believes that
    "boundaries between loved ones" is a sign of disrespect/distrust. TBH, I think that's one of his key issues that
    needs the people around him to handle (yeah and that includes my mom as well). He certainly has a lot of problem
    with regard to patterns of attachment etc. My grandma has really "endowed" this family a lot of childhood problems
    because she was unfortunate enough to have an extremely insecure childhood herself (war time, broken family, etc).
    It wasn't her fault, but it is also clear that this insecurity has been passed down for generations. Addressing this
    problem takes some very systematic effort. For more information check out the [update](@/blog/first_post.md) to
    the first post of this website.
    - He's deployed deepseek locally by himself. He's quite technically adept ngl and I respect him for that. I haven't
        even deployed models locally on my own machine yet (beyond on the lab machine).
- Mommy issue progress log \[1/???\]. Progress: she'd like me to leave her voice messages. That's probably a good
    idea since
    1. She probably want to hear my voice (and I want hers too 😢)
    2. Provides a certain level of privacy (better than plain text I guess).
    Look forward to more conversations during the week.

### 一周总结

对照年初制定的[新年愿望](@/blog/new_year_resolution.md)，本周做得好如下：

- [x] 按时吃饭。完成的很不错
- [x] 保持健身习惯，并维持自己的进步。这一点基本做到了，卧推开始推新重量
    （虽然没有保护还是胆小），开始好好练习三头/肩膀。本周周初还跑了几次步。总之运动方面做的不错。
- [x] 在网站上每日小结+每周总结。虽然有几次补档，但总的来说做到了。
- [ ] 🚧 从头到尾完成CS项目。目前正在进行中。手头是自己学习MIT 6.S081 （操作系统）。
    实在是本校当年OS实操内容太少了，为了求职得靠自己多练习。
- [x] （本身不在新年计划里的内容）增加社交。这周为社交做了不少努力，而且从情绪上也给了我很多正回馈😄

没有做好的

- [ ] 没有学习下围棋。这个挺不好的。说实话下围棋本来的计划是找个训练AI下棋，目前连配置都没弄。
- [ ] 使用LLM和其他工具做日程管理。这个也没做到。说实话其实可以做的更好，而且长期来看对我保持心态有很大帮助。
- [ ] 春假攒钱计划，自从联系楼下咖啡厅人家没有回复之后就没有跟进了。如有可能还是做点能攒点钱的事情。
