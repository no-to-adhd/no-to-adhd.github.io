### 运动健身

今天与TC同学一起健身，成果如下
- 卧推50kg×12, 55kg×7, 55kg×8 （有进步，目标2个月内推上65kg×12）
- 二头弯举12.5kg×12, 12.kg×10×2
- 哑铃推肩12.5kg×12×3
- 龙门绳索下拉

Overall, it was a good exercise session. I'm especially pround that
I've finally managed to push up to 55kg for the first time (the last
breakthrough was Nov 2024, it has been a long time). That means at
least on the gym front, I'm back on track 💪

#### 其他的话

Seriously, in case you missed it. "🤷‍♂️ okay..😊". I'm not sure if you get this,
in what ways are they reciprocal, but yeah, that's what I really wanted to say today.
