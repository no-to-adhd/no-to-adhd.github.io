### 运动健身
- 1710-1810 今天与TC同学一起健身，成果如下
    - 卧推50kg×12, 55kg×7, 55kg×8 （有进步，目标2个月内推上65kg×12）
    - 二头弯举12.5kg×12, 12.kg×10×2
    - 哑铃推肩12.5kg×12×3
    - 龙门绳索下拉

Overall, it was a good exercise session. I'm especially pround that
I've finally managed to push up to 55kg for the first time (the last
breakthrough was Nov 2024, it has been a long time). That means at
least on the gym front, I'm back on track 💪

### 休息时间
- 1545-1615 Tried to get a coffee at the college bar and spent some time
    outdoors today. Walked through Kings and took those pictures above.
- 1830-2000 Had (discounted) pizza and snacks with TC. Was watching Brooklyn 99
but my friend VC reached out to talk about her burn out. Honestly couldn't
focus on either and felt like I've been giving bad advice towards the end. I hope
that the fact that she got to talk about it make her feel better tho.
- 2100-0000 Slept for 3 hours
- 0510-0600 Slep for another 1 hour (the next morning)

### 其他的话
Seriously, in case you missed it. "🤷‍♂️ okay..😊". I'm not sure if you get this,
in what ways are they reciprocal, but yeah, that's what I really wanted to say today.

### On Efficiency, ADHD, etc
🚧 (WIP) 🚧
