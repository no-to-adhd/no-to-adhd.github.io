### 高效时间
- 0630起床
- 0700-0830 Drafting for the journal entry [yesterday](@/journals/2025-02-18.md) + Breakfast
- 1300-1400 Completed the implementation part of the PyTorch self study project I'm doing (and this is worth being happy for)
- 2000-2100 Reading the papers for R01
- 0300-0510 Reading the papers for R01 and Wrote the review （次日）
- 0600-1000 Wrote the review （次日）

### 运动健身
- 1710-1810 今天与TC同学一起健身，成果如下
    - 卧推50kg×12, 55kg×7, 55kg×8 （有进步，目标2个月内推上65kg×12）
    - 二头弯举12.5kg×12, 12.kg×10×2
    - 哑铃推肩12.5kg×12×3
    - 龙门绳索下拉

Overall, it was a good exercise session. I'm especially pround that
I've finally managed to push up to 55kg for the first time (the last
breakthrough was Nov 2024, it has been a long time). That means at
least on the gym front, I'm back on track 💪

### 休息时间
- 1545-1615 Tried to get a coffee at the college bar and spent some time
    outdoors today. Walked through Kings and took those pictures above.
- 1830-2000 Had (discounted) pizza and snacks with TC. Was watching Brooklyn 99
but my friend VC reached out to talk about her burn out. Honestly couldn't
focus on either and felt like I've been giving bad advice towards the end. I hope
that the fact that she got to talk about it make her feel better tho.
- 2100-0000 Slept for 3 hours
- 0510-0600 Slep for another 1 hour (the next morning)

### 其他的话
Seriously, in case you missed it. "🤷‍♂️ okay..😊". I'm not sure if you get this,
in what ways are they reciprocal, but yeah, that's what I really wanted to say today.

### On Efficiency, ADHD, etc
_It is important to note that this section is completed on the 2025-02-21. Learnings
and insights gained from then would be included in this journal entry as a result._

I've been experiencing a lot less ADHD symptoms this Thursday and Friday than
before. A few things have changed over the last two days:
- Most notably, I'm "forced" to visit the department. As a result, I met people
    I can talk to (including on Thursday, where I've had a long and fruitful
    conversation. I gained more experience (and therefore more certainty)
    navigating my thoughts and my current emotional situation). Ultimately, while
    I'm happy to be by myself, I think it is also crucial that, for 1 hour or 2
    each day, I'm surrounded by my friends, who can offer valuable advice in
    times of need. This is especially true in cases where I cannot reasonably
    analyze the situation, either because of my lack of experience, or because
    my judgement is somewhat clouded.
- My talk with my friends has led to more clarity on things in my life that
    I need to prioritise, and some concrete actions I need to take. This led
    to concrete plans for the near future, which I'm now working towards.

Other irrelevant but equally important points learnt:
- As the speaker, leave gaps in your speech so that your audience can ask questions;
    as the listener, you show the speaker your interest in the speaker or the speaker's
    thoughts by asking questions. (This tip came from an episode on a life
    improvement podcasts where the scenario was set to be a date (where a 6'5, blue eyed,
    finance guy massively failed a date because he wasn't interested in asking questions))
    but I guess it applies to a broader class of situations in the end.

One of the "mature" things I have learnt over the past few days is that
it sometimes doesn't matter how "good" or "bad" a situation you find yourself
in. Sometimes the only thing that matters is "what's the best thing you can
do to make it better". Though it stems from the same learning that "you can't go
back to change the past", I still have to live by it (which I guess I am, increasingly
so).

Overall, while I have indeed almost "wasted" my Tuesday and Wednesday this week
deal with some of my mood swings and ADHD symptoms.
