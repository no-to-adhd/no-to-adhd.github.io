> While my dad works very closed to the PM now, the PM still has the final say. Though in reality he just does a lot of rubber-stamping. -- Random dude sitting beside me in Harvey's café.

When I heard him say that, it just makes me realize the kind of large, messy place I'm living in. I'm no longer shielded
from nepotism or any other thing which was absent from back in school.

### How I've spent the day

Slow start today: slept at 0243 yesterday in break of recent traditions; slept for an
hour or so with the lights on and went to undress and turned the lights off at 0100;
had some bad dreams after tucking in and finally fell asleep at about 0344 😭

Woke up at 0630 as usual and felt super shit... As expected. But otherwise, I've had a
perfect breakfast and a great start to my day.

### Note to myself

- 早起绝不要先看手机。实际上相对专注的一天非常快乐，不需要看社交媒体也可以让自己身心愉快。
- The solution is to have a morning routine: for me at the moment, it would be as simple
    as standard morning hygiene, a cold shower, and a good breakfast.
