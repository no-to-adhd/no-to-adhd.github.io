### 高效时段
- 早上0740-0900: Learnt Golang
- 早上1050-1250: Learn Golang + Write interpreter Chunk 2
- 下午1400-1515: Write interpreter chunk 3
- 晚上2000-2130：Job applied × 3

### 背景学习
- 晚上1900-2000: Learnt about "concrete" ways to improve my current
    mental wellbeing/life choices. At the moment the classification
    using existing tools does seem to be more of a "stigmatising
    framework" than a useful one, which is why I should only use it
    to find out what I'm not necessarily good at, but not to limit myself.
    用中文说：MBTI是一个框架，关键是把他当作架，而不是框。

### 有效休息
- 0900-1015: 健身：卧推50kg×12 + 55kg×9×2; 滑轮组下拉57.5kg×15×3 (注：这个数据肯定不准，但
    稳定的使用）

### 今日习得

今天在专业上收获不少，主要有以下几点：

##### 怎么读大型代码库
理解大型代码库一直是我的一个痛点。好几次课内/外作业，我都因为不能理解已有的大型代码库而
感到十分困惑，并因此拖慢了进度。今天看到了一个比较有用的视频，仅供参考：

{{ youtube(id="SVB_iJhpqTA")}}

- You ***CANNOT*** really understand a large code base. Especially for a code base
    with millions of lines of code, even genius developers working in top
    companies probably only understand the directory they're working on. So
    just don't be bothered if you cannot fully understand a code base -- it's perfectly normal.
    Be *fearless* when you dive into a code base, knowing that it is normal to not understand
    everything. To understand a code base you need to be *willing to be confused*, at least for
    a long while.
    - To exactly undertand a code base, at least the part you'd be interested in, do multiple-passes.
        In general, human brains functions more like ML algorithms and not traditional deterministic
        ones. You look at the codebase, pattern recognize things, which adjusts the weights in your
        brain. You look at it again, learn something new, adjust the weights again... Until probablistically
        you get a good grasp of what's going on.
    - Be honest with what you understand. You might fool yourself into thinking that you understand
        something until you try to generate output. Don't be afraid of admitting that you don't understand
        something your friends do: just ask them, and now you'd understand those as well.
- You don't need to build an intuition around a code base, you just need to be "sufficiently familiar"
    with it.
- Just like (in the original video they've been talking about the parenting, where "you shouldn't
    be expected to understand everything that's going on in the kids head, you just need to be
    there and understand the specific problems if the kid is having some problems", this is in fact
    probably a fair advice for any kind of intimate relationship as well. Don't try to poke into
    the other person's head and attempt to understand everything. Leave where the boundaries are set).
- Maybe don't look at the main function and trace through execution: you'll get too deep into the
    rabbit hole and miss the big picture; instead follow the file structure, which is organized
    in a more human readable way.

##### 通过MBTI学习走出来的方法

虽然不清楚我的测试是否准确，但我确实缺乏extroverted thinking的勇气和实践。Introverted thinking可以将
自己的情绪与外界剥离开，extroverted thinking则可以让我厘清外物运转的规律。两者都可以帮我走出困扰我多年
的情绪困境。

据网上的说法，写日记，整理自己的思路也算是Te的一种行为。所以很庆幸在1月底之后能够基本坚持做这件事情。

就我今天的具体实践来说，其实还是陷入了一点分心的陷阱。虽然基本上没有花太多时间刷娱乐内容，但是学习的
内容其实与我当下最紧迫的任务其实还是有点距离，更多的是满足我自己“自己在进步”的情绪（虽然学习到的技能
与我今年毕业论文高度相关），但总体来说其实还是可以优先解决求职 > 毕业论文 > 平时任务这样的顺序。
