I have learnt to recite the _litany against fear_, over the last couple of
days. When I first watched that movie, I never could quite understood
the whole part on "An animal caught in a trap will gnaw off its own leg to
escape. What will you do?". To me, 断臂求生 seemed like a normal thing to
do. What other options do you have?

In that sense, I truly wasn't really different from animals, acting
upon my fears and emotions and less so my intelligence. I act upon
my first instinct, express my outrage without a second of hesitation.
This was what I seeked for going into this relationship 8 years ago,
tired of calculating my moves, and hiding away my feelings.

But there is some subtlety there: fear, or, more specifically, the fear of
pain, death, misfortune, fear of a specific future, is always going to be
there regardless. An animal gnaws off its own leg because its acting out of
fear, struggling to get out of the cage because its fear compells it to.
A human may observe the trap, ponder about what could be done, when the hunter
is coming back, save his strength and act just when the hunter comes around.

Life is not going to play out as if it's a pre-written story ready to be played
out, it is an adventure in which we always have to face things we fear the
most. To let it get the better of me was never going to be good to people
around me, even if I felt I got immediate relief. My family taught me to be
afraid of the consequences of failures and misfortunes, which supposedly was
their way to teach me to think and plan beforehand. Unbeknownst to them, It
played out completely in reverse in me, because I let the fear conquer me from
the other side. My response now is therefore to embrace my fear, and only by
knowing what causes the unrattling in the deep, do I understand more what needs
to be done, what needs to be fixed, and what needs to be cherished.

### 其他的话

- *Really Stupid Thing*: I just realized that my LinkedIn account was linked
    with my other Gmail account, an account only until recently did I check01 out
    again, and I've missed so many careers related emails since the start of
    application season last year (╥_╥).

{% spoiler(spoiler_alert="🐷: I've got some long confession to make here, and I'm hesitant for you to see") %}

I've been missing her more today. Maybe it's because I'm less busy, or maybe
she's been less attentive to my messages, a sign that, at least from my point
of view, she's less interested in me. It kinda hurts to know that, even when
I'm supposed to be moving on. But then again thinking about it, that's how
she's always replied to my messages over the past month or so. What's painful
wasn't how she's replied (or not), but the painful realization that, however
much she doesn't care now, she hasn't for the past couple of months, but my
numb and insensitive heart didn't get the distress call at the time. I was
imagining a perfect relationship, one which has a long history of commitment,
and, where the pain of long distancing will end in almost no time. I will make
time to see her during the spring break, and everything will be fine the moment
our eyes crosses and give each other a hug. Or so I thought.


It is only the loss of a long relationship that made me realize that the best
way to maintain it was when you're still in one the other person's life. Now
that I'm increasingly, slowly but surely, edged out of hers. All of a sudden
all the things I can think of to do, things that might have worked if we were
still together, became less acceptable simply because we're not in a
relationship anymore. What am I even supposed to do as a friend? Can I still
show that I really care about her and want to do (much belated, maybe too late)
anything beyond what friends normally do? Does she like the idea that I still
care and want or does she want me to leave her alone? I don't know. I don't
know. I don't know.


I still believe that maybe ending our relationship was the best thing to do.
Perhaps the moment she heard from me that it's unlikely for me to be in
Singapore next year, and so there's no concrete way for the two of us to be
physically together for another year and a half, was enough to convince her
that there's too much pain to endure in the forseeable future for things to
truly work out. Being in long distance is hard, turning it from less than a
year to close to two years has made it even harder, and, on top of that, if
there's already a not so healthy relationship to begin with, I can't imagine
painful it must be. Perhaps she viewed my unwillingness to move to Singapore as
a sign of no commitment, or perhaps she's afraid of all the fight she's gonna
get from me to work one more year at ARUP (because, of course, I really want
her back). There's so many, so many reasons that she could be unhappy with this
relationship, that the moment I put myself in her shoes I felt sorry. When long
distancing became a burden in her mind(and frankly mine as well), it is best if
we give it some time to break (and that's just me) (and yes, she thinks it's
over, at least not until life, or, deliberate choices we make, brings us back
together again).


I don't know, the reason why I didn't want our relationship to end wasn't that I know
exactly how to make a long distance relationship work, or that I wasn's worried and
wasn't frankly suffering just a bit down my heart as well. It was the bigger
fear of uncertainty that made me want to hold on to it, even when I knew there
was something seriously wrong there. I can't imagine her being with someone
else, and, oh boy don't get me started when her new relationship starts to get
physical. In my mind, the future stops on that day, and the fear of this
potential future prevents me from fabricating a future story beyond that point.
I still love her, and love sometimes is selfish.


But _I shall not fear, for fear is the mind killer. I will face it, let it pass
on and through me, so when it's gone there will be nothing left. Only I will remain_.
So I must acknowledge that, this is a not an unlikely scenario, at least by the
end of these two long years. She's an attractive young female who's enjoying
her mid twenties, just started her day job and is enjoying life in most sense
of it. Man will be **crazy** for her for more than just one reason, reasons I
know too well and have felt too deeply. (And to not torture myself I will not
think too much about exactly _who_ is the next person going to be like, I've
got soo many candidates out in my mind, and, oh boy). I should have realized
that, the moment she said "she didn't want to **WAIT**", there is unfortunately
something deeper there. It is a future that I have to embrace, to accept that,
by the end of the day, she wasn't all wrong when she said "It's a shame, but
I'm also glad that we've broken up." I wasn't thinking deeper when I first
heard that, I was confident that, now that I feel _truly_ different over the
last couple of days, by the time she meets me again, our chances are still
high. I didn't realize that hidden betwene the lines is something about the
very concept of _time_ itself: it's a shame that what we've had happened then
and there, and there's no going back. It is a painful realization, but to dwell
on it would be counted as misery. So that's just that: I need to learn to move
on, every last bit of it. I need to learn to realize that, I should NOT be
hoping for reconnection or getting back together, because it leads to misery,
and, less self development. The latter is the last thing I want on my table.
