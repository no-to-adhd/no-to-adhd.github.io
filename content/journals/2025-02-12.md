### 高效时段
- 0600-0845 读文章，准备周会内容
- 0900-0945 周会。导师评价不错，顺便聊了很多PhD相关的内容。

### 中效时段
- 1000-1200 读Systems文章。效率一般

### 有效休息与社交
- 1800-2200 元宵聚餐+talking to people before and after

### 不太高效的时间
- 1400-1600 虽然手头还有工作，但还是胡思乱想良久

### 今天的观察
- 美中不足：没有跟在Arm工作的同学多讲两句(座位隔的有点远，我为招呼所有同学最后落座)。下次再见面可能就有点困难了。

### Highlight of the day
Bye bye anonymity!

Yeah I haven't learnt how to smile, and the picture was a bit of an
after thought so I had my whole winter jacket on. As computer scientists,
all I can say is: cherish this while our hair lasts.

### 其他的话

Apart from not being able to do enough work between 1400-1800 (was quite distracted
by a number of things going on, but ultimately I couldn't read the papers for
R01)，I guess it is a happy day.

I haven't met my project supervisor in a long time, and my excuse for doing so
include "I haven't done enough work to show yet" to "I really have no time this
week to work on this". But I'm glad that I spent the last three days
reading relevant papers and working on this project (and with some intensity as
well). My supervisor even said something like "even though we didn't get to
meet for a while, it seems that you are very organized and you've made good
progress/you are in a good spot". I'm quite flattered by this to be honest.

Towards the end of the afternoon, I broke a rule. I cold feet called Isla
and wished her 元宵节安康, and, subconsciously wouldn't want to say goodbye,
lingered on for 10 more minutes. Her response sounded lukewarm and, perhaps,
just a little irritated. I guess I'm just time and again reminded that, the
most rational thing I can do now for both of us is to wait it out. Let life
without each other build itself out, and by the end of it, we'll have better
clarity on what had happened, and some better clarity on the present as well.

I couldn't be happier meeting my fellow compscis at the end of the days. I've
only talked to about half of them throughout the last 3 months, partly because
I never had to chance to meet at all before I tried to spend more time in the
ACS lab (nevertheless the ACS lab is freezing🥶, but I guess the appeal of
having two 4k monitors to myself is somehow worth it. Just bring a warm
waterbag.) They are, sweet people above all else, smart and witty just as I'd
expect. I like them, and I guess for the next 3 months I wouldn't want my own
incompetence (in an academic sense) to cloud my judgement to those people
through a wiff of jealoucy and self-hatred.

I was thanked for organising the event and I was even called mature and
dependable by some of the bros on the way back. I knew they said that jokingly,
but again I'm equally flattered, but it also feels like a good place to start.

It was a long way back home, and there I was on the cobble street of Cambridge,
alone. It's been a while since I've spent time like that with myself, and it's
almost weird to relearn how it feels, to be unattached and to have no one on my
mind. Turned out I never was afraid of solitude, not when the solitude served a
purpose. It is only now that I can recall what happened before the fateful
summer of 2016, and to know that it wasn't all horrible before. I spent time
just like this, wandering in the world by myself, perhaps with a little less
purpose. I went to get 汤圆 earlier that year (so by the traditional calendar,
that must be exactly 9 years ago), looking for an adventure. The stories with
my parents weren't all horrifying, at least towards the start of my time in
Singapore. Nor was my story in my lower secondary back home any unpleasant,
there's plenty to remember by, and even as those memories fades with time,
many bits and pieces still comes back, through the warmth I felt when I tried
to recall, and through dreams that I occassionally still go back to.
Just like how I've crafted a story for myself to tell me how fortunate I was
with her, sometimes serving unjustice to other people in my memory, now that
she's out of my life, the plot also took a twist, and the story took a turn.

A misty night as it was, and I was just glad to be back home.
