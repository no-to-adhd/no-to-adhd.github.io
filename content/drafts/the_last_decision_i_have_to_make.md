Today's post is about my last lingering decision, the last remaining piece
of my puzzle before I finally navigate out of the breakup.


It's been almost three weeks since my breakup, and for the first time in a while,
I've reach out to my parents and my aunts. I told them about the breakup, and
they were, of course, being quite supportive (and they told me)


I guess one of the things that does keep me forward is love, or to be more
specific,

I still miss her. And yes, I went to watch the movie because of her instagram
story. It's a lovely story, a great one that I find too many resemblance to our
own. Even the reason for then final breakup... I don't know. I want to screen
this movie to her in a cinema in the UK when she does arrive, even though that
means I will need to work for 30 hours to save up for this. I just want a
chance for us to shrug and say "okay". I'm ready for a new life and in some
time a new relationship. I'm ready to love someone again, this time more
maturely, less attaching, more respectful, more understanding, less needy, more
responsible, more trusting and trustworthy, less controlling, and above all, a
better person whole would grow and help grow in healthy ways. I've learnt that
the hard way from her, yet I want her to be the first one who'd enjoy these new
changes in me.
