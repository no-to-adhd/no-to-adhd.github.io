- 今天King's的鸟鸣很独特啊，但大家都找不到它
- 今天早0930-1030期间出现了一段逐渐加深，最后变得很严重的抑郁情节。1030左右站起来去给麦片打牛奶的一瞬间，
    心理默念了一句有点抽象、不太易于言表的话，大意是“我已经有一个小时的时间发泄我的情绪了，今天发泄的时间已经很多了，
    已经体会到我最难受的想法了，打住吧”。一念通达，突然一下情绪就好起来了。之后与J同学有说有笑起来了。
- 今天一早去看验光，验光师检查的还挺全面的，甚至还问我dissertation topic哈哈。意外的是，散光没有增加，度数倒是涨了。
    总体来说其实早上的体验还不错，验光师服务态度还是过关的。以前觉得I just want things done. 现在觉得，身边无论是谁
    给我的善意我都还是很appreciate。Every little bit help.
- 睡的太少了，也影响了今天一开始的情绪。我迫切的需要一个可以补觉但起来不会emo，或者不补觉但可以减少疲劳的方法。Recommendations
welcomed
- 下午与🐷聊了一次。其实也是我抒发感想啦，虽然她聊天的内容还是因为种种原因让我多少心态有点折磨，但总的来说
    - 我已经下定决心 不再去挽回她，或者为她额外做什么事情了。我们大可以做有很多共同经历的朋友。
    - 说实话，我已经看到过她纯真，最温柔，最体贴的一面了。我觉得我没有遗憾了。或许之后她还能变得更有魅力，但已经不重要了。
    - 我不会再去选择不能坚定选择我的人。虽然这次分手复盘下来，其实还是我们没有成熟的去管理我们的感情，互相有效沟通。两个MBTI有点
        F倾向的人在一起，在没有一次成熟恋爱的经历的情况下，互相没有做到好好沟通彼此的需求，前几年说实话也没有做到共同成长。
    - 周日晚重新看了分手前最后几个月的聊天。冷静分析后得出如下判断(同下条)
- My dad got emotional again and despised her for breaking up with me in this
    unfortunate moment (and how she's been affecting my mood a bit from time to
    time). He said something which, I initially identified with (especially after
    what she said to me on Saturday, which I think is a bit hurtful (the part where
    she's saying she's getting a lot of attention by dressing up, and that she's
    quite in the mood for another relationship)). There is, definitely a sense of
    betrayl (and the feeling that I'm a 备胎 of some sort, which sucks). But after
    reviewing our messages for the last month of our relationship, I've come to the
    following conclusion: 
    - Adjusted conclusion: I think Isla didn't do anything that fundamentally
       对不起我 in the relationship. And I understand and respect her decision for the
       breakup. I think she proposed it more like taking a break but evolved to a full
       on fallout in the end. I do think leading to and during the breakup itself she
       could have taken a lot more responsibility in addressing some of the issues
       instead of simply putting it as "oh I think I've just had a change in heart",
       or "I think I want a relationship that starts out from adult attraction",
       and own up to her part of the problem (avoidance problems), even if
       intuitively that might have appeared to her like so. In the relationship,
       she in particular and to a lesser extent me, has cultivated an atmosphere
       which neither side should provide honest criticisms, which therefore prevented
       the two of us from truly growing in this relationship.

       Another thing which I believe, from her part, has harmed the relationship, is
       that she was never able to truly commit to the "relationship" as a shared future.
       There are, on my parts, things which I failed to do well in. Managing my own
       emotions and sensitivities is one of them. Being more active in shaping my
       life and changing for the better is definitely another. But for her to not
       show a sign of true commitment to the relationship has always been a problem,
       and has fueled my insecurities in a way that harmed this relationship.

       On the otherhand, I believe that this problem in a future relationship
       can be best resolved by being a role model in things which we believe
       the other party should improve on. Then the rest goes without too much saying.

       Either way given our long history and entanglement I still think she's brave
       to walk out of her comfort zone and get ready to start again. I'm happy for her
       new stage in life, and I do hope in long term (when I'm more happy with myself
       and financially more secure) I get to reconnect with her either as just a
       friend or potential love interest. But at least in a short term (1-2 years or
       even maybe 3) I really want to focus on my own life now.
