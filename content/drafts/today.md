# 2025-03-19

- Abs crunches, bench press and bicep training
- UPimulator work: figure out exactly how I'm going to implement things
- Write the bloody email to be sent
- Apply for more jobs at Arm, GraphCore, Square Point, other fintech C++ roles
- Write the cover letter for Arm, complete the application
- Complete MathWorks application
- Email Rob Mullins, tell him I've got to work on the MSP deadline
- (Optional) If I have some spare time, work on the parser; haven't written
    anything for a bit, and I'm getting grumpy because of that

- MSP Part I assignment: I think I'm going to do this with the help of gen AI.
    I can and should do the second part myself.
- MSP Part II: this part is actually interesting. I'm going to watch about 8 hours
    of lectures to catch up followed by 4 hours of revision and 8 hours of problem
    solving. I will prioritise this part over the first part over this weekend.
    - To break it down even further:
    1. Watch lectures 2-3 today (22/03/2025)
    2. Try to form a coherent story through my notes (after the lectures)
    3. Before watching the lectures, write down exactly my questions when I
       first look at the questions in the assignment.

- Stack: buy that/those books and get it reimbursed.
