This list maintains a log of activities completed on each day, including but not limited to:
- Productive work (with tangible learning outcome)
- Not so productive "work" (communication, chores)
- Time spend on totally unproductive activities (e.g. doom scrolling on social media without remembering anything useful)
- Time spent on resting (proper sleep, meditation, mental quizes etc.)
- Meta-activities (e.g. keeping logs, reflections, plan making etc.)

The most important point of this list is to keep track of what I'm doing, and to accumulate data and insight for analysis.
