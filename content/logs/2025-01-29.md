### Things to note down for further understanding

* _Weird interaction_: I went downstairs to the Gym do a set of bench press
    because both my eyes and chest hurts a little from having too little sleep. I
    just finished my warm up and felt a bit cold. Just when I was done with my warm
    up round, an acquitance came in and was about to use the bench. My immediate
    reaction (without allowing my brain to kick in) was to get up and left him to
    use the bench, **EVEN IF HE ACTUALLY SAID I WAS THERE FIRST AND HE CAN WAIT**.
    So what's going on here?

* _Nap/Sleep Fcks my mental state_: I have had a few cycles of gathering waking
    up → gathering my strengths up → became excited and productive → took a nap →
    had my feelings reset to a bad ground state (feeling sadness and loss). Each time
    I read a bit of what I wrote down on [2025-01-28](./2025-01-28) and felt
    better, but what was going on there???

    It seems like taking naps resets my mood to a bad ground state? How does that
    work?

* [Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto 3](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1QX4y1q7zw/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click)
    is becoming my new favourite piece. It is complex enough to not make me
    think of good "golden" memories (unlike Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto D
    Major) and therefore avoids throwing me into a state of nostalgia and
    remorse, yet it is "happy" and "exciting" enough to help me get out of bad mood
    and be productive. Hats off to Rachmaninoff.

* Disrupted Sleep Schedule. Unfortunately, I won't be able to sleep well again today.
    This is fine considering
    1. The unexpected time spent on R244 mini-project.
    2. I've spent some part of today working through my mentals.
    3. I have (barely) procrastinated at all today, close to 0 time spent on
       Bilibili. The day is super productive, at least something is learnt,
       felt or accomplished at almost every moment of it. I'm proud of today.

    Thankfully, I will finaly be able to have a good night's sleep on this
    Thursday😊
