### Photo Booth (or something like that)

如果我最美好的记忆注定如[流沙](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xAmQ4y44eo&ab_channel=%E9%99%B6%E5%96%86DavidTao)一样从我掌中流走，那么请让我用这个小网站记住它；如果我美好的故事还能[延续](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY3D_14-AC8&ab_channel=PlainWhiteT%27s-Topic)，那请让我们相逢时，看见这些故事时能[相视一笑](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNZH-emehxA&ab_channel=ShaniaTwainVEVO)。总之，我有我不想忘记的事情，请让我**一定一定**不要忘记。

### Knowledge Base

There's no reason why this site can't double as my personal knowldege base,
especially when it comes to some of the more interesting technical projects
I've been working on. Using it as a knowledge base also diversifies the content
and encourages me to post on a daily basis.
