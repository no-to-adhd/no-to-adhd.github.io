### Photo Booth (or something like that)

如果我最美好的记忆注定如流沙一样从我掌中流走，那么请让我用这个小破站记住它；如果我美好的记忆还能延续，
那请让我们再次看见这些故事时能相视一笑。

### Converting between Neorg knowledge base and this site

* [ ] Experiment with writing the blog posts in [Neorg](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg)
    * [ ] Automatically convert `.norg` to `.md` using neorg builtin tools.
    * [ ] Add parsing options for additional tags like `[taxonomies]` in the
        markdown exporter.

### Work logging

* [ ] Github activity like activity log for this blog.
* [ ] Extend the blog to include other statistics.
    * [ ] Daily pomodoro clock.
    * [ ] Weekly exercise log.

### Knowledge Base

There's no reason why this site can't double as my personal knowldege base,
especially when it comes to some of the more interesting technical projects
I've been working on. Using it as a knowledge base also diversifies the content
and encourages me to post on a daily basis.
