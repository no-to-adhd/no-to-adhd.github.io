According to the career officer, in the UK

> 70%+ of the open roles are not publically advertised!!!

This day just never seized to amaze me. This career consultation has given me
the most clarity on the matter I've had so far. It could just be that I've
never taken concrete steps looking into this matter, but I'm really glad that I
was brave enough and went for it the moment the opportunity arise.

Here are some of the (totally unorganized) takeaways from this 45 minutes session:

### Application Seasons

There are in general, two types of applications:

* _Graduate Schemes_, which opens from September to Early December.
* _Open Positions_, which opens ~4 months before the start date.

### How to Know if Certain Qualification is Needed

The most statisitcally sound way is to look through the data. LinkedIn is a good
place to start.

#### Statisitcal Evaluation

* Go on LinkedIn and search for alumnis who are working in the field of interest,
    especially if they remain in the field some time after graduation (usually
this means that they've progressed into a senior/managerial role).
* Look for the qualifications they have who's working in the target organizations
    in the field of interest. Make a tally and compute the percentage.
* Reach out to at least 3 people who fit our profile for a quick interview:
    * To reach out: draft the initial contact with the following components
        * Intrigued by your work
        * Cambridge integrated masters student in the final year of studies
        * Parallel with my experience/interests
        * Ask if they might be open to a 10 minutes conversation on Zoom or similar
        * Usually about 25% to 20% of people would reply.
    * For the interview
        * Ask about their transition from Uni to Industry
        * Ask about the impact of their work and their views of the career in the industry
        * Ask for the entry point requirement in the industry

#### Drawing Connections, Target Organizations and Job Titles

Using the alumni accounts collected above, focus on profiles which attracted
your attention, especially ones who's career looks very interesting to you,
collect the stats of their career, with a focus on their past experience,
connected organizations, and job titles. This will form the basis of jobs
that you will apply for.

### Undisclosed Job Opportunities

***More than 70% of the job opportunities are not publically advertised.***

In order to be know the existence of these roles, and to then be able to
apply for them, essentially repeat the interview process in [Stat Evaluation](#statisitcal-evaluation).

However, a few tweaks are required:

* Same email (message) format
* Target mid-management (team leader, project lead etc.) People who have contact on the
    ground but also managerial position and powers.
* Ask the same questions, but for the last 3 minutes, ask:
    * Thank you for the information. Are there any opportunities where I can get some
        more practical exposures? (If affirmative, may get job shadowing, etc.)
    * Thank you! Do you think there's someone else I can perhaps talk to who has
        more information and insights? (In this case, the person would be offering
        his/her networking + their selection process).

### How to Process the Job Requirements

* Usually, one should be happy if you fit around 60% or more of the requirements.
    The requirements listed are usually 
* Apply for roles even if they ask for work experience. As a fresh grad, so long
    as they don't ask for 3-5 years of experience, it is usually a good idea to apply.
* ***ALWAYS*** apply for internship when possible. Internships are big organization's 
    internal procress to create and manage their talent pipeline, so it provides
    more opportunities, and is also a safer choice for these organisations than
    grad-hires based on 1-hour interviews. Even if the organization states that
    they only hire penultimate years, essentially ignore this requirement and apply
    anyways. If you create values for the organization in the first place, then
    there's no reason why they won't hire you afterwards.
* Collect the stats of all the requirements of roles you're interested in, and
    make sure to prepare for the top 5 most common requirements to maximise your chances.

### Career Advancement Tips

* Your first job matters to a certain extend, but is often overestimated by the student population
* In the early career (first 2-3 years) people are expected to move around.
* So long as you've landed a mid-tier organization with the right context,
    career progression is still very much possible.
* To get into certain top-tier organizations (your dream organization so to
    speak), you should aim to get into these organizations within 3-4 years after
    graduation. After that it would be a lot harder to progress in terms of the
    tier of organization you're in.

### Timeline
`TODO: make a diagram for this`
1. Starting from late Jan - Mid Feb: collect stats from LinkedIn as in [Stat Evaluation](#statisitcal-evaluation)
2. Starting from Mid Feb - March 1st: arrange interviews
3. March 1st onwards: apply for those open roles!!!
