Even though I've already wished my viewers happy Women's Day on my journal entry
on 08-03-2025, for those of you who haven't seen it,

> Happy Women's Day again! I wish you all infinite fulfilment and accomplishment ahead.

### Photo Dump?

I've decided to dump some photos here. Treat it as a form of cloud storage (after losing an
afternoon's worth of data (of my most active day I can remember)) I've decided to dump my
photos whenever I see fit. People training ML on data published on GitHub (e.g. Microsoft)
can probably use it as you will.

### Concert @ South Bank (2025-03-01)

> Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto!!!! My favourite violin piece of all time.  
> NGL, after what happened this year, the music just hits so differently now.  
>  
> And just when you thought it couldn't get better, there's Mahler!! Though, boy,
> Mahler has definitely gone through some serious depression/anxiety episodes to have
> written what I've heard. Sound exactly like the noise in my ear last year... For
> those of you who don't know what's it like to have an anxiety attack from my perspective,
> listen to this and you'll know.
