It has been a heck of a month.

I guess I've always been an extrovert, but it took me all these years make that
connection back. I've always enjoyed good company, I enjoy being surrounded by
friends, doing cool or silly things together. I have perhaps, lost that when I
set foot in Singapore, feeling lost and excluded (I was also excluding them
because, back then at a boy school, the kids were **LOUD** af and they kinda
bother the 16 year old me). But the lost of that crucial connection, the
disparity between then and the time when I must have befriended at least half
the guys and a quarter of the girls in my class back in China, made me sad,
lost and lonely. I guess I was also bothered (at the time) by the fact that I
cannot get the unique attention of friends now that they're moving on with
their lives in separate ways, that I cannot take more of their time, which
thinking back, makes me want to pat that little version of me.

Fast forward to uni, that feeling got stuck with me. I'm glad that I've been
reached by people who cared enough to reach out to me, and by no surprise
those were the people who lived with me in the the household in student
accomodation. They are, a lively and noisy bunch. "Immature", I thought, not
knowing that, years later, I'd realize I'm the immature one, who's been
troubled by my traumas in my earlier years and never managed to walk out of it,
and they are the ones who were either smart enough to walk out of them
earlier by themselves, or fortunate enough to have never been through those
in the first place. In one way or another, I missed out on meeting them,
and increasingly so as I moved to my own excluded household on the outskirt
of the city in my second year.

I thank my friends for not leaving me after all those years being slightly
disconnected from them. I avoided going to sesh with them, avoided drinking
most of the time, and that has led me to my fear that I'm perhaps no longer
welcomed back to the group now that I failed to spend enough time with them.
And I'm so glad I was wrong. I'm almost dumbfounded by just how much support
and care I've received from all kinds of different friends over the course of
the last month. I never knew I had such a wonderful support system, I've always
felt just a little bit distant. But the moment I reached out to them, I can
feel that support system spinning up like a GPU cluster training a 1 trillion
parameter model. And damn that system is powerful. (And I did not know I've got
all that many GPUs in that cluster!!! Some V100s from years back in secondary
school, A100s from in high school, many more from Uni, whom I didn't even know
would help me to that extent when I approached them.)

Right now, I feel like I'm at a point in life where, I'm happy just by myself.
I guess a lover's company could make it better, but I don't feel miserable
without it. And that's such a departure from my experience going through a
withering long distance relationship over the winter just prior to the break
up, when I could feel the tension and insecurity building up inside me.

"Independence is somewhat overrated, it's a concept cherished by teenagers who
were too old to do what kids do, and too young to do what adults do", a quote
by Scott Geller from a recent video I watched (which turned out to be useful).
"Adults look for inter-dependence, where you build yourself a community". Now
I feel like I'm in one, and more than that, I can manage, build and maintain
a corpus on my own.

I guess I'd thank my friend for their company at this
