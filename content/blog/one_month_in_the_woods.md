It has been a hell of a month.

% TODO: add a paragraph here

I guess I've always been an extrovert, but it took me all these years make that
connection back. I've always enjoyed good company, I enjoy being surrounded by
friends, doing cool or silly things together. I have perhaps, lost that when I
set foot in Singapore, feeling lost and excluded (I was also excluding them
because, back then at a boy school, the kids were **LOUD** af and they kinda
bother the 16 year old me). But the lost of that crucial connection, the disparity
between then and the time when I must have befriended at least half the guys
and a quarter of the girls in my class back in China, made me sad, lost and
lonely. I guess I was also bothered (at the time) by the fact that I cannot get
the unique attention of friends now that they're moving on with their lives in
separate ways, that I cannot take more of their time, which thinking back,
makes me want to pat that little version of me.

I thank my friends for not leaving me after all those years being
slightly disconnected from them. I avoided going to sesh with them,
avoided drinking most of the time, and that has led me to my fear that
I'm perhaps no longer welcomed back to the group now that I failed to
spend enough time with them. And I'm so glad I was wrong. I'm almost
dumbfounded by just how much support and care I've received from all kinds
of different friends in the last month. I never knew I had such a wonderful
support system, I've always felt just a little bit distant. But the moment
I reached out to them, I can feel that support system spinning up like a GPU
cluster training a 1 trillion parameter model. And damn that system is powerful.
(And I did not know I've got all that many GPUs in that cluster!!! Some V100s from
years back in secondary school, A100s from in high school, many more from Uni,
whom I didn't even know would help me to that extent when I approached them.)

Right now, I feel like I'm at a point in life where, I'm happy just by myself.
I guess a lover's company could make it better, but I don't feel miserable
without it. And that's such a departure from my experience going through a
withering long distance relationship over the winter just prior to the break
up, when I could feel the tension and insecurity building up inside me.

"Independence is somewhat overrated, it's a concept cherished by teenagers who
were too old to do what kids do, and too young to do what adults do", a quote
by Scott Geller from a recent video I watched (which turned out to be useful).
"Adults look for inter-dependence, where you build yourself a community".

I don't know, but I feel truly, truly happy right now.
