昨日立春。

I've spent another afternoon, anxiously waiting for 🐷 to check out my new website.
Deep inside, I wanted to prove that I still have her attention. I waited
eagerly for views of the website from a Singaporean IP, eager to look at what
she'd be interested in amongst the myriad of new journals blogs posted since
the last time she checked: probably around last thursday or so. Since then, she
has not visited this site even once: no comments, and not even a single view
according to the analytics. Deep inside, I can feel the pain, knowing that for
whatever reason, she doesn't want to pay attention to my life and she's really
moving on. 

I told two of my friends about this website, telling them to check it out
regularly, and at least one of them did. Any expression needs an audience, and
when the supposed/intended audience doesn't pay a visit, even for the right
reasons, it still feels frustruating that it is the case. So now, I'm showing
this to my friends, including bits that are cheesy, or even borderline
inappropriate (because those are very heartfelt message I originally left for
her). I want to be heard, and, when I've lost my regularly listening ear, I
desperately needed to find a few more pairs.

I spent much of this afternoon in agony, feeling the pain in my chest building
up. I couldn't take it anymore. After half an hour of conversation, a full on
"Big Five" test actually used in the Psychology Department (as opposed to MBTI
which seems to generalize less well), and a soothing music session in which my
friend J played live music that truly touched me, I still could not forget the
pain I was feeling: the moment we stopped contacting each other, I'm
being forgotten, left intentionally and perhaps happily out of her life. My
stomach wrenchs, and I couldn't help myself anymore: I texted her on 📕, asking
if she's already fallen asleep. An hour later, I thanked her for not replying:
I needed this, both the pain and the knowledge that I can resolve it on my own.

For whatever reason (perhaps I was being exploratory or, I just wanted relief,
maybe I just wanted to find ways to cry about it), I opened up Bilibili, and
started watching the last bit of 四月は君の嘘. It was one of the first animes
that 🐷 and I watched together and, my hunch tells me that it also makes for
a good closure.

Watching the last bit of 四月は君の嘘 again makes me soooo sad. I knew this is
going to make myself melancholic, but I went on with it anyways. I knew the
story well enough to feel the resemblance: having her left my life is like
loosing a best friend, a family and a lover all at once. The parallelism I see
with the protagonist on the powerlessness we both felt was so overwhelming
for a while, even though in the story the protagonist was facing his loved
one's almost inevitable death, whereas in my case I was watching (from hindsight)
my own relationship falling apart piece by piece, only to realize what's
going on when it was all too late. The plot is also probably objectively less
severe: 🐷 is still around, enjoying her life, while 宮園かをり is gone,
forever. Yet, to think that 🐷 isn't in my future anymore, sometimes feels just
as bad, if not worse. _Pain isn't a competition_, the severity of someone
else's pain doesn't diminish that of my own, when it's there, it's there.

All of a sudden, I start to recall a comment of this anime I've read a 7 years
ago, one which, at the time, seemed out of touch to me: 四月は君の嘘 isn't just
a teenage love tragedy, a story that finds its place in the 少年 section of the
manga store for younger people. It is instead a story about growth, about the
inevitable loss one faces in life, and about how to rise up stronger from all
of that, a story for the grown-ups (or perhaps, adults who have yet to grow
up). The way the anime ended doesn't make it a just a tragedy: quite the
opposite, it makes it serious, realistic, and meaningful, and even heart
warming. After all, it was not just only the love from かをりthat kept 有馬公生
going, what's more was what かをり taught him: to love life, to have faith in
the future, and to love everyone around him. Just like かをり, what 🐷 taught
me through this heartbleeding break up, amounts to exactly that: to cherish
life, every single second of it.

I've always teared up every time I watched 四月は君の嘘's last episode. I've
always thought I've had a relationship just as beautiful, and I was afraid of an
abrupt end to it, just like in the story. Yet, when the relationship has ended, in
many ways just as abruptly, I've finally come to understand the the story as was
told (and perhaps intended by the author): life isn't a fairy tale, people walk
into your life, sometimes quietly, without their shoes on, find their ways into
your heart, leave a dent, and then quietly tip-toe away. Yet their departure
doesn't mean that they've vanished, quite the opposite: they have, willfully
and whimsically, without any room for argument, found a permanent place to stay
in your heart. They've made themselves an unforgeable and indelible part of
your past, and, in doing so, made them a gentle yet permanent part of your
present, just as alive and just as real as what you see, hear and feel right
now. They shade my reality through a filter of love, empathy, and optimism,
and they give me the courage to face my present and my future, to live my
life to the fullest, as they would have if they are around, and as they will
surely want me to.

So instead of crying this time, I looked at it and smiled. A spring without
you... is coming.
