        <section class="body">
            <p>(Disclaimer: this post was ideated and written before the radio black out)</p>
<p>In today's Sunday special, we look at tattoo aftercare, since a good friend
is getting her first tattoo done. After all these years, somebody's dream is
coming true!</p>
<p>So on this special occasion, being a practical person who's totally unqualified
on the subject matter, it is time to share my total untested knowledge about
tattoo aftercare. "<em>It's gonna hurt, but it's also gonna heal. By the time the
pain subsides and the tattoo is set, someone is leaving a beautiful mark on
their skin.</em>" (nobody said that, and it sounds lame). But in between this
process, there's something I've scraped from the internet (and also Amazon)
which might help you go through the process smoother, more painless, and end up
with a more vibrant tattoo in the end.</p>
<h3 id="totally-unoriginal-content">Totally Unoriginal Content</h3>
<p><em>This section was first found on the r/tattoo subreddit, by
u/solomonplewtattoo, based on his profile he seemed to be a
tattoo artist, so I'll take his words for this particular matter. This blog
only reformats the content because the original post was a reddit post without
the help of proper formatting. I hope you enjoy reading it.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>TLDR; listen to your tattoo artist who would have a good idea as to what to
with your tattoo. Bring the product to the shop and ask if the tattoo artist
would recommend it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many misconception for tattoo aftercare. I wrote this to help guide
people in their healing experience, answer questions and give overall
understanding of why we do what we do. With that said, listen to what your
artist instructs you to do.</p>
<p>The main aftercare process and healing process should last about <strong>2 weeks</strong>. It
might take a little less or more time depending on the tattoo. <strong>Fine line heals
quick</strong> (hopefully that the one you're getting) and highly saturated tattoos can
take longer.</p>
<h5 id="washing-your-tattoo">Washing Your Tattoo</h5>
<p>Your <em>first wash happens right after you remove your
bandage</em>. Wash 1-3 times a day depending in how dirty the area gets. Use
unscented antibacterial soap such as Dial gold, Dove or Dr. Bronners. Bar or
liquid soap are both fine. <strong>Avoid applying the soap directly to the tattoo</strong>.
Using your hands, get the soap sudsy and wash gently for about a minute. Rinse
and air dry. <em>Do not dry with hand towel. You can dap dry with a clean paper
towel if you are in a hurry</em>.</p>
<h5 id="lotion">Lotion</h5>
<p>Lotion. Your body heals the tattoo not the lotion. The lotion is for keeping
your skin from drying out too much and keeping the healing tattoo more
comfortable. In fact, you can wait up to 3-4 days after getting the tattoo
before putting it on. But that's personal preference. Apply unscented lotion
1-3 times a day. Apply very thin layer of lotion, your skin shouldn't be
shinny. Less is more. Recommendation lotions are Cetaphil, Lumberderm and
coconut oil. You can also use specific aftercare cream, but it does the same
thing and costs way more. I don't recommend aquaphor or other petroleum based
products. These are often applied too thickly and can suffocate the skin.
However, if used correctly, they can be a great option especially for highly
saturated tattoos.</p>
<h5 id="things-to-avoid">Things to Avoid</h5>
<p>Things to avoid while your tattoo is healing!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Submerging your tattoo in water</strong>. Swimming, baths, hot tubs, saunas, etc.
These WILL make your tattoo fade fast, heal poorly and greatly raises the risk
of infection. Limit showers to 10 minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The sun</strong>. A sunburn will make your tattoo heal poorly. Do not put
sunscreen on in the healing process, keep the tattoo covered by clothing. <strong>After
it's healed</strong> use sunscreen as the sun will age the tattoo faster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Re-bandaging your tattoo</strong>. Unless given instruction by your artist, don't
do this. It doesn't need it and if you don't clean it probably, you raise your
chance of infection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Healing creams/balms and antibiotic ointments</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Creams</strong>. Don't use them. They make your tattoo heal poorly. However, if
you have an infection seek professional help and follow their instruction.
If they say use anti-biotic cream use it.</li>
<li><strong>Scented lotion/ soap</strong>. Avoid these, they make your tattoo heal poorly
and your skin can have a bad reaction from them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scratching/itching/picking</strong>. Let your scabs do their thing. If your tattoo
itches you can <em>gently</em> slap it (it really works) or scratch around the area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tight clothing</strong>. Tight clothes add extra friction and can rub off scabs,
irritate the skin and in extreme cases cause pressure blowouts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="saniderm-and-similar-bandages">Saniderm and Similar Bandages</h5>
<p>You can leave on up to 5 days. <em>Remove in shower after running warm/hot water on
it for a few minutes to losen up the adhesive</em>. Wash tattoo with soap and air
dry.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pros: Heals tattoo well. Easy to use and makes the first few days of the
process dummy proof. You can see the tattoo through it. Great for places that
are hard to wrap with other bandages.</li>
<li>Cons: some people have an allergic reaction to the adhesive. It can suck to
take off. It can fill with fluids like blood, plasma and ink which some people
find off putting. Costs more money. Not great for places with lots of movement
like joints.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="short-term-bandage-wraps">Short term bandage wraps</h5>
<p>Leave on for at least 4 hours or until the following morning. Remove and wash
tattoo with soap and air dry.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pros: heals tattoo well. easy to use and remove. Great for arm and leg
tattoos. You don't have to keep in on as long as saniderm. Cheap in cost.</li>
<li>Cons: harder to use on torso.</li>
</ul>
