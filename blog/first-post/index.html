        <section class="body">
            <p>This is the first post of my new blog, and as the title suggests, is here to
celebrate a new beginning.</p>
<p>As someone who is desparately reluctant to move myself into new and unfamiliar
situations, a recent chain of events has sent my world crumble down in front of
my eyes. Remorse, fear, regret, and everything in between has started to
encroach me whenever my mind wanders off the tasks at hand. To allow these
feelings to take hold of me was, for many years, my instinctive response. The
comfort of knowing that someone had my back, was enough for me to justify to
run away from the problems, internalizing these failures as if there's nothing
that can be done, jumping from one temporary escape to another, convincing
myself that I am at a spot where temporary complacency can be jusified.</p>
<p>Until that someone decides to leave my gloomy nest of excuses in search of a
bright, warm place in the world where she well deserves.</p>
<p>A new beginning was, therefore, emergent. Not only because that's what I
voluntarily called for, knowing that allowing my life to slide further down is
no different to being suicidal, but also that there is perhaps, a slim but
present chance that my life can indeed be saved.</p>
<p>For the longest time, I have suffered from what I (perhaps for my own excuse)
described as the "symptoms of ADHD". I have been unable to focus on anything
for long periods of time, and I have been unable to keep my mind on one task
for long enough to my satisfaction. My mind wanders off anything difficult
at the sight of it, fearing the consequences of failure without even embarking
on the task. Since I have never had formal diagnosis of it (perhaps not even trying
hard enough to get it diagnosed even if I <strong>did</strong> have it), it could be best
called <strong>PADHD</strong> (<strong>P</strong>retended <strong>A</strong>ttention <strong>D</strong>eficit <strong>H</strong>yperactivity
<strong>D</strong>isorder) <em><strong>HAS RUINED MY LIFE</strong></em>.</p>
<p>And so, this is where I want to start, a proclamation of war against my own
disease, and hopefully by the end of it, a piece of history that is well worth
remembering. I cannot assume that there's someone in the world who is going to
bear with all my inadequacies (and frankly, no one should. My own faults for
many years, comes with their own price). There's not going to be anyone who is
going to comfort me, and tell me that I've done my best so I can lie to myself
that I did. By the end of it, I may be as broke and broken as I am right now,
never to get back what's already lost. But <em>that's not the point</em>. The point is
that I <em>will</em> survive the mental detriments of PADHD, and by the end of it,
become a more <em>trustworthy, reliable</em> person than I was before.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-blog-is-going-to-be">What this blog is going to be</h2>
<p>The purpose of this blog is to say the least, complicated (like my current mess
itself). It is on one hand a project on its own, a good motivating reason for
<a href="../backlog">many, many interesting expansions</a> that finally gets my hands on
some practical coding, a good reason for me to <em><strong>want to code</strong></em> for a truly
good reason.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is a place where I force myself to commit to things, one
at a time. It is a place for me to learn about myself, how I work and how I can
improve, and a place where I can put my thoughts down for everyone to see. I
wish to expose my mind to the world, dissect it and fix it with a lancet; but
at the same time, the consistency itself serves as a source of confidence, to
tell myself that I can indeed not only commit to a uncomfortable task, but also
to accept the consequences of failures, hostility and setbacks.</p>
<p>Last but not least, it is perhaps a good place for me to also drop down some
of my memories, some of the best ones that I can still remember, some of the
ones that kept me going. For any of my audiences (of which I only know one), it
is perhaps a good place to peek into my past, and draw a little bit of a smile
at the end of it 🤗.</p>
<p>(to be continued.)</p>

<h3 id="update-2025-02-16">Update 2025-02-16</h3>
<p>I told my parents that I have been making a website to keep track of my progress,
write down some emotional stuffs. My dad this week insists on me telling him
the url. Here's our conversation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dad: 你的自建网站网址？你不是说你自已建了一个网站？<br />
Me: 对，但是我需要一点空间？有些话对自己说可以，有别人看就变味了。我做这个网站的目的是当自己的日记本+实验一些技术。希望可以理解<br />
Dad: 我的时间和精力都非常有限，对隐秘和八卦没有兴趣。你多虑了，只是你上次说，你将计划什么的也贴在网上了，让我也看一下。否则，我也不会提此事。<br />
Me: 爸爸，很感谢你这么关心我。抱歉回复您这么晚，我花时间组织了一下语言。</p>
<p>做这个网站的初衷，除了想在技术上做一些有意思的事情以外，最重要的是有一个机会与我自己内心对话。我已经很久没有体验过内驱力了，之前我做事情的动机里，有因为想获得他人的认可与支持，有出于对结果的畏惧，唯独没有“我真的很想做某件事”或“我真的很想提升自己”的念头。漫无目的，随时希望下辆车开上人行道撞死我。这是我一段时间前内心的真实写照。</p>
<p>经过这段时间，我觉得我内心终于有“想要提升自己”的想法了，并很坚定的在这个方向上努力，做这个网站也就是记录下我的这个过程（选择网站的形式则是觉得网站在技术上可以有很多拓展的方向，可以额外作为练手的项目）。像我在这个网站的前言里写的，做这个网站的目的就是对我自己绝对诚实，既不刻意对自己苛刻（靠自我批评来事实上逃避改变），也绝不春秋笔法颠倒黑白，凡事对自己做到实事求是。这绝不是一个容易达成的目标，但有一块精神上的自留地能帮助我训练自己去厘清我繁复的情绪，直面自己的内心。</p>
<p>很感谢爸爸这么关心我的成长。但是这一次，我觉得越是如此，我越是要更独立的走完这条路，完成自己的改变。我担忧如果您关注我的网站，我撰文的（部分）动机会退化成“为满足父母的期许，逃避父母的责难”，那就与我十年前的自己别无二致了。</p>
<p>我知道您很想多了解我的生活，老实说，我也畅想能与您无拘无束，敞开心扉畅所欲言的时候。但我们之间有的误会，久而久之已经成为习惯和执念。无论是真正了解我自己，还是破执，都是是一个需要时间的过程，希望您能给我一些时间空间。我相信那一天的到来不会太久远。</p>
<p>至于八卦，隐私，从来都是身外之物，本来也不是我拒绝您的原因。</p>
<p>期待下周联络！</p>
<p>Dad: <em>&lt;some very stuffs he says when he's upset/feels rejected&gt;</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though this conversation didn't go exactly as I intended, nevertheless, I think I've made a point about what this website is:</p>
<p>A place where I can honest with myself, figure things out, and propel further changes to my life.</p>
